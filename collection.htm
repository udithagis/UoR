<p class=MsoNormal>Abstract: Precipitation is a key component of the
hydrological cycle and one of the most important variables in weather and
climate studies. Accurate and reliable precipitation data are crucial for
determining climate trends and variability. In this study, eleven different
precipitation datasets are compared, six reanalysis and five observational
datasets, including the reanalysis datasets ERA5 and WFDE5 from the ECMWF
family, to quantify the differences between the widely used precipitation
datasets and to identify their particular strengths and shortcomings. The
comparisons are focused on the common time period 1983 through 2016 and on
monthly, seasonal, and inter-annual times scales in regions representing
different precipitation regimes, i.e., the Tropics, the Pacific Inter Tropical
Convergence Zone (ITCZ), Central Europe, and the South Asian Monsoon region.
For the analysis, satellite-gauge precipitation data from the Global
Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP-SG) are used as a reference. The comparison
shows that ERA5 and ERA5-Land are a clear improvement over ERA-Interim and show
in most cases smaller biases than the other reanalysis datasets (e.g., around</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13% high bias in the Tropics compared to 17% for MERRA-2 and
36% for JRA-55). ERA5 agrees well with observations for Central Europe and the
South Asian Monsoon region but underestimates very low precipitation rates in
the Tropics. In particular, the tropical ocean remains challenging for
reanalyses with three out of four products overestimating precipitation rates
over the Atlantic and Indian Ocean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. Introduction</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In meteorology, precipitation is usually defined as rain,
snow, sleet, or hail falling towards the surface from a cloud. As a key
component of the hydrological cycle, precipitation is of very high
socio-economic importance and is relevant to many aspects of life [1].
Precipitation is therefore also one of the most important variables in weather
and climate studies [2]. Accurate and reliable precipitation data are crucial
for determining climate trends and variability [3] including impact relevant
indices such as floods and droughts, and are important for the management of
water resources, in the agriculture, forestry, and energy sectors, and also for
weather, climate, and hydrological forecasting [4]. In particular, gridded
precipitation datasets play an important role in evaluating and assessing the
performance of global Earth system models (ESMs) (e.g., [5–7]) used for
projections of future climate change [8]. Other examples of scientific
applications of global precipitation datasets include the analysis of heavy
rainfall over the Asian–Australian monsoon region [9], drought monitoring in
China [10], or the diagnosis of rainfall over South America during strong El
Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events [11].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rain gauges are normally used to measure precipitation as
point data directly at the Earth’s surface [12]. It is, however, almost
impossible to create a gap-free, long-term precipitation dataset from rain
gauge data alone since the measurements are almost entirely available over land
only, and there are regions where the density of measurement stations</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Atmosphere 2021, 12, 1462.
https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos12111462            https://www.mdpi.com/journal/atmosphere</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is low or non-existent even today. In addition, local
topographic features are known to influence rain gauge measurements, which can
make calculations of precipitation values that are representative for large
areas quite challenging. In contrast, satellite measurements provide more
comprehensive spatial coverage and are not limited to land regions. A drawback,
however, is their limited temporal coverage. Most satellite measurements of
precipitation have only been available since the 1990s. Such datasets based on
satellite measurements include, for instance, the TRMM-L3 dataset [13] or the
PERSIANN-CDR dataset [14]. One of the most widely used measurement datasets in
the climate science community today, however, are a combination of rain gauge
and satellite measurements such as the GPCP-SG dataset [15].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Particularly in regions of very sparse instrumental
coverage, reanalysis products are sometimes used as an alternative to
observational datasets. For the production of modern reanalyses such as the
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis ERA5
[16], satellite, precipitation radar, and gauge measurements are assimilated.
An advantage of reanalysis datasets is their globally complete and relatively
long temporal coverage. A clear limitation is, however, that biases can be introduced
by non-perfect models including, for instance, unresolved processes relevant to
clouds and precipitation formation or uncertainties in used parameterizations
and initial conditions. This is particularly relevant in regions with sparse
observations such as over the oceans or in high-latitude regions where there is
little effective constraint of the reanalysis solution and the fields are
largely driven by the model physics and parameterizations (e.g., [17]).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Given the differences in measurement techniques between
ground-based and satellite measurements, and the differences in creation
between measurement datasets and reanalyses, it is maybe not surprising that
different precipitation datasets show differences in both the magnitude and
variability of precipitation estimates. Typically, reanalysis datasets show a
larger degree of variability than the other types of datasets such as
satelliteor rain gauge-based datasets with the degree of variability varying by
region [2]. Large differences in annual and seasonal estimates between
reanalyses and observations are found over the tropical oceans, in complex
mountain areas, in northern Africa, and in some high-latitude regions [2]. It
is therefore important to compare datasets from different sources and different
providers. A number of such comparisons exist already, but they are typically
either focused mostly on observational data (e.g., [2]), include only selected
reanalysis and observational datasets (e.g., [18–20]), concentrate on specific
continental regions such as, for example, the continental U.S. [21],
North-Western Himalaya [22], or a river basin in China [23], or focus on
selected ocean basins (e.g., the Southern Ocean [24]).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The analysis presented here includes a comparison of eleven
different datasets consisting of six reanalysis and five observational
datasets. Three of the datasets (ERA5-Land, GPCC and WFDE5), are only available
over land. All analyses presented here are focused on monthly mean
precipitation rate values, although for some datasets higher temporally
resolved data are available. This study focuses on the Tropics, in their full
coverage and also separated into land- and ocean-only regions, and two
additional regions within the Tropics that are known for special precipitation
regimes, including regions with known high biases. To be able to put the
analysis of the Tropics in a general context, some global analyses and analyses
focused on Central Europe are also presented. The aim of this study is to
quantify the differences between the widely used precipitation datasets
generated from different data sources and to identify their particular
strengths and shortcomings including the recent reanalysis product ERA5 and the
bias-corrected product WFDE5. The analysis focuses on monthly, seasonal, and
inter-annual times scales.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The analyzed datasets are described in Section 2. Section 3
presents the methods and tools used. A comparison of the precipitation datasets
including maps of precipitation climatologies, histograms, time series of
area-averaged mean values and anomalies, and area mean annual cycle evaluations
is presented in Section 4. In Section 5 the findings of the comparisons are
discussed and summarized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. Data</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following sections provide an overview of the eleven
datasets used in this analysis. The particular observational datasets were
chosen since they are widely used in climate sciences (GPCP-SG, PERSIANN-CDR,
GPCC [2,25–28]), or provide an independent precipitation estimate (TRMM-L3 [13]
and E-OBS [29]). The reanalyses ERA5, ERA5-Land and WFDE5 were selected since
they are quite recent reanalysis products and have not been extensively
discussed in previous comparisons. ERA-Interim was added to the comparison
since it is the predecessor of ERA5 and has been used extensively by the
climate community (e.g., [30–33]). The datasets JRA-55 and MERRA-2 were
included in the comparison as they are well established reanalysis products and
they are produced by data providers other than ECMWF who produce the ERA5 and
ERA-Interim products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The main characteristics of the datasets are summarized in
Table 1, including information about temporal coverage, spatial resolution,
version number, and the main dataset reference. Datasets that have been used in
[34] for the analysis and evaluation of climate models contributing to the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6 [35]) are marked with an
asterisk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.1. E-OBS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>E-OBS is a daily gridded dataset with a high spatial
resolution that covers the European region over land and is based on station
data collated by the European Climate Assessment and Dataset (ECA&amp;D)
project. Currently, about 70 years of data from 1950 to present are available
and the dataset is updated frequently. All station data are sourced directly
from the European National Meteorological and Hydrological Services or other
data-holding institutions. For a considerable number of countries, the whole
national network of stations is used [44]. Most station time series are quality
controlled by the respective agencies, but are also subject to further quality
control following incorporation into ECA&amp;D [36]. These data are then
blended with time series from neighboring stations to form more temporally
complete series [45]. The E-OBS dataset was used for research purposes
including the validation and calibration of model results [29,46] and
monitoring the climate across Europe [45]. Since version v18.0e, the dataset
provides an improved estimation of the interpolation uncertainty obtained from
of a 100-member ensemble of realizations of each daily field [36].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.2. ERA5</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fifth generation of the ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) replaces
the highly successful ERA-Interim reanalysis [38]. ERA5 is based on
four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation using Cycle 41r2 of the
Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), which is coupled to a soil model and an
ocean wave model [47]. Here, ERA5 data were used that are served on the
Copernicus Climate Change Service Climate Data Store (CDS) [47]. Atmospheric
data are available on 137 hybrid vertical levels and are provided on the CDS interpolated
to 37 pressure levels ranging from 1000 hPa (near surface) to 1 hPa (about 80
km) [48]. The monthly mean precipitation was calculated from the daily values
that were accumulated from the sub-daily datasets [48]. More information about
the ERA5 dataset can be found in [16].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.3. ERA5-Land</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ERA5-Land is an enhanced reprocessing of the land component
using a higher resolution model version and taking ERA5 as an input, allowing a
horizontal resolution of 9 km at hourly time steps [49]. Here, ERA5-Land data
were used that are served on the CDS and are available on a regular 0.1&#9702;
× 0.1&#9702; grid, covering only land surfaces. Missing values are marked as
such, so that zeroes can be interpreted as no precipitation [37]. The
precipitation is interpolated from the same variable of the ERA5 product and
used as a forcing field for the enhanced replays [49]. The monthly mean values
from ERA5-Land provide averaged values of accumulated precipitation for each
time step [50].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.4. ERA-Interim</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ECMWF reanalysis ERA-Interim [38] is a global
atmospheric dataset covering the time period from January 1979 through to
August 2019. The dataset is commonly seen as the predecessor of the ERA5
reanalysis. The assimilation system used for ERA-Interim is based on Cycle 31r2
of the ECMWF IFS 2006 release, which includes a 4D-Var analysis. The dataset
provides a temporal resolution of either 3 h (forecast) or 6 h (analysis)
depending on the variable and is provided at a spatial resolution of
0.75&#9702; × 0.75&#9702; (approximately 79 km) and on 60 vertical levels from
the surface up to 0.1 hPa. More details are available at
https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era-interim
(accessed on 1 September 2021) [51].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.5. GPCC</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The centennial Global Precipitation Climatology Centre
(GPCC) is operated by Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD). Its Full Data Monthly
Product of monthly global land-surface precipitation is based on about 80,000
stations world-wide that provide data records of 10 years or longer [39]. It
covers the time period from January 1891 through to December 2016. The data
coverage per month varies from about 6000 (before 1900) to more than 50,000
stations. The Full Data Monthly Product is updated at irregular time intervals
following significant improvements in the underlying data base. Monthly data
are available on regular grids with different spatial resolutions (0.25&#9702;
× 0.25&#9702;, 0.5&#9702; × 0.5&#9702;, 1.0&#9702; × 1.0&#9702;, and 2.5&#9702;
× 2.5&#9702;). Precipitation anomalies at the stations are interpolated and
then superimposed on the GPCC Climatology V2018 in the corresponding resolution
[39] instead of interpolating the absolute precipitation totals [52]. In this
analysis, the dataset with a resolution of 0.25&#9702; × 0.25&#9702; was used.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.6. GPCP-SG</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) was
established by the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) as part of the Global
Energy and Water Cycle Exchanges (GEWEX). As a community-based analysis under
the auspices of WCRP, GPCP was developed by an international consortium of
researchers and operational scientists who provide datasets, products, and
techniques [15]. The dataset covers the satellite era from 1979 to present on a
global 2.5&#9702; × 2.5&#9702; grid and is produced by merging a variety of
data sources, including passive microwave-based rainfall retrievals from
satellites (SSMI, SSMIS), infrared rainfall estimates from geostationary (GOES,
Meteosat, GMS, MTSat) and polar-orbiting satellites (TOVS, AIRS), and surface
rain gauges [15,53]. The most recent version 2.3 of GPCP-SG provides an
improved homogeneity, especially in the time period since 2002 [15].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.7. JRA-55</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) provides a reanalysis
dataset called JRA-55</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(known as the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis) [40]. JRA-55
covers the time period from the beginning of global observations by regular
radiosondes launches in 1958 to the present [54]. It is produced using the
TL319 version (as of December 2009) of JMA’s operational data assimilation
system. The reanalysis is based on different observations in addition to the
45-year reanalysis data (ERA-40) provided by ECMWF. JRA-55 was the first
comprehensive atmospheric reanalysis that applied 4D-Var analysis to this period
[55]. Reduced model biases, improved dynamical consistency of analysis fields,
and an extension the time period back to 1958 make JRA-55 suitable for studying
multi-decadal climate variability and climate change [55].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.8. MERRA-2</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and
Applications, Version 2</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(MERRA-2) is produced by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration’s (NASA) Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) and
provides data from 1980 to the present, using an updated version of the Goddard
Earth Observing System Data Assimilation System Version 5 (GEOS-5 [56])
atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) with a 4D-Var data assimilation
scheme. MERRA-2 is the first long-term global reanalysis to assimilate
space-based observations of aerosols and represents their interactions with other
physical processes in the climate system [41]. The dataset contains hourly
fields at a horizontal resolution of 0.625&#9702; × 0.5&#9702; and 72 sigma
vertical levels up to 0.01 hPa interpolated to 42 vertical pressure levels from
1000 hPa to 0.1 hPa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.9. PERSIANN-CDR</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed
Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR)
is a retrospective precipitation dataset based on multi satellite data,
developed by the Center for Hydrometeorology and Remote Sensing (CHRS) and
designed to be used for climate and hydrological studies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dataset provides daily rainfall estimates on a
0.25&#9702; × 0.25&#9702; grid between 60&#9702; S and 60&#9702; N from 1983 to
the near present and is available through the CHRS Data Portal [57].
PERSIANN-CDR combines infrequent, but high-quality passive microwave (PMW)
observations from lower Earth orbits with infrared (IR) observations from
Geostationary Earth orbiting (GEO) satellites at high sampling rates [14].
Generally, algorithms are limited to the availability of the required input
data. For the PERSIANN-CDR, neural networks are used to compensate the missing
PMW data for the pre-1997 period to provide a high spatial resolution over four
decades [58,59]. The primary input for the PERSIANN model is the Gridded
Satellite IR (GridSat-B1) data from the International Satellite Cloud
Climatology Project (ISCCP [60]). Monthly GPCP v2.2 data, which also contain
surface rain gauge data [53], are used to calibrate the model at a 2.5&#9702; ×
2.5&#9702; resolution. PMW observations are used to update algorithm
parameters. The bias-corrected PERSIANN precipitation estimates maintain a
monthly total consistent with the monthly GPCP product [14]. The calibration of
PERSIANN-CDR to data from GPCP introduces a dependency on the GPCP data
although the datasets are not based on the same sources.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.10. TRMM-L3</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is a joint
mission between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)
providing rainfall data for weather and climate research. The TRMM satellite
launched in 1997 was equipped with a threesensor rainfall suite, which includes
a Precipitation Radar (PR), the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI), and a Visible and
InfraRed Scanner (VIRS) [13]. The TRMM satellite collected rainfall and
lightning data for 17 years in the latitude belt 50&#9702; N to 50&#9702; S
until the mission ended in April 2015. Postprocessing of the data, however,
continued. The algorithm 3B43 was developed to produce the single,
best-estimate precipitation rate and root mean square (RMS) precipitation error
estimate field. For this, 3-hourly merged high-quality/IR estimates (which are
also available as dataset TRMM-RT) are combined with ground-based radar data
and a monthly accumulated rain gauge analysis (from GPCC) to apply a largescale
bias adjustment to the multi-satellite estimates over land. The combination of
satellite and surface rain gauge data is similar to the GPCP-SG dataset [61].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.11. WFDE5</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The WATCH Forcing Data methodology applied to ERA5 (WFDE5)
is provided at a horizontal resolution of 0.5&#9702; × 0.5&#9702; and at a
temporal resolution of 1 h covering the time period 1979–2016. It replaces the
predecessor WFDEI [43]. WFDE5 has a higher spatial variability than its
predecessor since it is generated by the aggregation of the higherresolution
ERA5 data [43]. The dataset was derived by applying the sequential elevation
and monthly bias correction methods described in [62,63]. The bias correction
for rainfall and snowfall flux is either based on the Climatic Research Unit
dataset (CRU TS4.03 [64]), or based upon a combination of the dataset from CRU
and that from GPCC v2018 [65]. In this study, the used data were bias corrected
with both CRU and GPCC data. For simplicity, the WFDE5_CRU+GPCC dataset is from
hereon called WFDE5. The total precipitation variable of WFDE5 was calculated
as the sum of the rainfall and snowfall flux.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. Tools and Methods</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.1. Earth System Model Evaluation Tool</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All analyses in this study were made with the open-source
community diagnostics and performance metrics tool for the evaluation of the
Earth system models “Earth System Model Evaluation Tool” (ESMValTool [66–69]).
For use with the ESMValTool, the variables and metadata of the precipitation
datasets were reformatted following the CMOR (Climate Model Output Rewriter;
https://pcmdi.github.io/cmor-site/media/pdf/cmor_users_gui de.pdf (accessed on
18 June 2020) [70]) tables and definitions (e.g., https://github.com/P
CMDI/cmip6-cmor-tables/tree/master/Tables (accessed on 7 November 2019) [71]
for CMIP6). For this, the ESMValTool contains many scripts for reformatting
observational datasets according to the CMOR standard, including scripts for
ERA-Interim, WFDE5, JRA55, MERRA-2, GPCC, E-OBS and PERSIANN-CDR. The scripts
are publicly available on GitHub and are provided with the ESMValTool source
code (https://github.com/ESMVa lGroup/ESMValTool (accessed on 1 September
2021)). The datasets GPCP-SG and TRMML3 are available from obs4MIPs [72–74] and
can be used directly with the ESMValTool.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“On-the-fly” reformatting for ERA5 and ERA5-Land were
implemented in version 2 of the ESMValTool that allows the processing and
analysis of the raw ERA5/ERA5-Land data without having to preprocess the data
before running the ESMValTool.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All figures shown in this paper (apart from Figure 1) can be
reproduced with the ESMValTool “recipe” recipe_mpqb_precip.yml, a configuration
file defining input data, preprocessing steps, and diagnostics to be applied.
The mean, correlation, and rootmean-square deviation (RSMD) values were
calculated with a variation of the “recipe” recipe_lauer13jclim.yml.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.2. Geographical Regions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Precipitation measurements have substantial uncertainties,
especially if the precipitation amount is very small such as in the “drizzle”
range. Meaningful comparisons with models or reanalyses are therefore mainly
focused on large-scale patterns and climatologies based on monthly mean values
rather than small-scale features on short time scales. The following
comparisons include for this reason global maps of climatologies (multi-year
annual means) and biases. Certain precipitation regimes are typically found in
specific regions of the globe (see Figure 1). For these regions, histograms,
mean time series, anomaly time series, and annual cycles are analyzed:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•           Tropics: spans the latitude belt from 30&#9702;
S to 30&#9702; N over all longitudes. In this region convection plays a
dominant role and high temperatures allow for a high concentration of water
vapor in the atmosphere. This region is typically associated</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with high precipitation values;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•           Pacific Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ):
spans the region from 0&#9702; N to 12&#9702; N and 136&#9702; E to 85&#9702; W
in the Pacific Ocean. In this region deep convection occurs frequently
connected with large amounts of precipitation. Convection in the ITCZ is an
important driver of the global circulation (Hadley cell);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•           South Asian (SA) Monsoon: spans the region from
5&#9702; N to 30&#9702; N and 65&#9702; E to 95&#9702; E.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this region precipitation shows a distinct annual cycle
with the frequent occurrence of heavy precipitation in summer (monsoon);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•           Central Europe: spans the region from 42&#9702;
N to 53&#9702; N and 0&#9702; E to 20&#9702; E. This is a region where many
ground-based observations are available which are used for assimilation in
reanalysis products. In the winter half-year precipitation is dominated by
synoptic scale extratropical cyclones whereas in the summer half-year
convective processes are dominant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 1. Definition of the geographical regions for which
precipitation analyses were performed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.3. Regridding and Masking</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When calculating the difference between datasets or
correlations of a dataset with the reference dataset, all data were linearly
regridded to the grid used by the GPCP-SG dataset (2.5&#9702;× 2.5&#9702;, see
Table 1) using the regridding functions of the ESMValTool preprocessor [68].
Additionally, the application of land/sea masks, anomaly calculations, and area
selection were also performed with the respective ESMValTool preprocessor
functions. Grid cells were masked as missing if less than 80% of data from any
of the datasets were available. Due to the missing values present in the
ERA5-Land, GPCC and WFDE5 datasets over the ocean, and for the PERSIANN-CDR
dataset at latitudes higher than 60&#9702;, three different “mean” and
“correlation” values with respect to GPCP-SG were calculated in addition to the
selected regions mentioned above: global with both land and ocean grid cells
(ERA5, ERA-Interim, JRA-55, GPCP-SG, MERRA-2), global land-only (ERA5,
ERA5-Land, WFDE5, ERA-Interim, JRA-55, MERRA-2, GPCP-SG, GPCC), and 60&#9702; S
to 60&#9702; N with both land and ocean grid cells (ERA5, ERA-Interim, JRA-55,
MERRA-2, GPCP-SG, PERSIANN-CDR).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4. Results</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The analyses described in the next sections were mostly
performed for the four regions described in Section 3.2, with the Tropics being
analyzed as a whole but also separately considering land-only and ocean-only
grid-cells.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.1. Overview Statistics</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Table 2 provides an overview of the area weighted mean
values of the different datasets for the previously defined regions (Tropics,
with and without a separation of land- and ocean-only values, Pacific ITCZ,
Central Europe, and the SA Monsoon region) as well as for global, global
land-only, and the latitude belt 60&#9702; S–60&#9702; N for the common
analysis period 1983–2016. Additionally, the table also provides the
area-weighted pattern correlations with the reference dataset GPCP-SG, as well
as the area-weighted average root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from GPCP-SG.
The RMSD value is calculated as square root of the average of the area-weighted
squared residuals between the values of the respective dataset and GPCP-SG.
Values for RMSD are always positive, and smaller RMSD values indicate fewer
deviations from the reference dataset. With these reported metrics for each of
the discussed regions, Table 2 can be seen as numerical summary of the analyses
and findings described in Section 4.2, Section 4.3, Section 4.4, and Section
4.5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.2. Geographical Distribution of Precipitation Rate
Climatologies</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nine datasets were used in the comparison of global maps of
precipitation rate climatologies: five reanalysis datasets (ERA5, ERA5-Land,
ERA-Interim, JRA-55, and MERRA-2), three observational datasets (GPCP-SG, GPCC,
and PERSIANN-CDR), and one bias-corrected reanalysis (WFDE5). The common time
period covered by the nine datasets is 1983 to 2016. Similar to [34], GPCP-SG
was used as reference dataset when calculating the differences in precipitation
among the different datasets as this observational dataset is widely used as a
reference dataset for precipitation (e.g., [5,75,76]). E-OBS and TRMM-L3 were
not included in this analysis since they only cover limited regions of the
global land surface or their temporal coverage is shorter than for the other
datasets, respectively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The geographical distributions of the multi-year annual mean
climatologies of precipitation rates from all datasets calculated over the time
period 1983–2016 are shown in Figure 2. For this analysis, the datasets were
plotted in their native spatial resolution. This leads to a more detailed
depiction of the features of the precipitation rate visible in the datasets
ERA5, ERA5-Land, ERA-Interim, WFDE5, JRA-55, MERRA-2, GPCC, and PERSIANN-CDR
compared to GPCP-SG. Typical features of the well-known global precipitation
patterns are clearly present in all datasets: local rainfall maxima in the ITCZ
stretching in the Tropics from the West Pacific over South America to the
Atlantic, the tropical warm-pool region, the North Pacific and the North
Atlantic regions just off the coastlines of the USA and Japan, and the South
Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). These patterns are consistent with
geographical patterns that have been shown before (e.g., [2,15]).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 2. Global multi-year annual mean precipitation rates
averaged over the time period 1983–2016 from the nine global datasets covering
this time period. Data are shown in their native spatial resolution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Table 2 shows the climatological mean values for the
precipitation rates averaged over the three regions (1) global (land + ocean),
(2) global (land-only), and (3) 60&#9702; S to 60&#9702; N (land + ocean) and
the corresponding values of linear pattern correlations with respect to the
observational product GPCP-SG used as a reference dataset. It can be seen in
Table 2 that the overall mean climatological values for global and near-global
areas are higher for the reanalysis datasets (ERA5, ERA5-Land, ERA-Interim,
JRA-55, and MERRA-2) than for the observations (GPCP-SG, GPCC, and
PERSIANN-CDR), with JRA-55 as the highest in the category where land and ocean
values are both considered, and MERRA-2 as the highest in the category where
land-only values are considered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The pattern or spatial correlations are a measure to
describe how well a dataset represents the geographical distribution of
precipitation rate values. The closer the value for the spatial correlation is
to 1, the better the respective dataset reproduces the spatial distribution of
the chosen “standard” dataset (here: GPCP-SG). In general, the spatial
correlations between the different datasets and GPCP-SG are high (&gt;0.85),
especially if global data with both land and ocean values are considered. The
exception is the correlation between GPCP-SG with MERRA-2 that does not exceed
0.81 in all three analyzed global and near-global categories. Additionally, it
becomes obvious that the three purely observational datasets are very similar
(GPCP-SG, GPCC, and PERSIANN-CDR; correlation coefficient for PERSIANN-CDF for
the region 60&#9702; S to 60&#9702; N &gt; 0.99 and for GPCC for global
landonly &gt;0.95). The WFDE5 (bias-corrected reanalysis) dataset shows that
the overall values for the climatology and correlation are more similar to the
observations than the other reanalysis datasets. Overall, the different
datasets represent the geographical precipitation rate patterns well, and the
spread between the climatological mean values is rather small.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When looking at the spatial biases between the five
reanalysis datasets and the observational product GPCP-SG (see Figure 3)
features of well-known problems become apparent: there is a wet bias over the
tropical and subtropical oceans, the Arctic Ocean, as well as over Central
Africa and the Indian Ocean. Additionally, there is a dry bias over parts of
the Northern Hemisphere (NH) continental areas, the northern part of Africa,
and over Antarctica. It also seems that the reanalysis products show an overestimation
of precipitation rates in high mountain ranges such as the Andes and Himalayas.
Interestingly, the wet bias over Central Africa and the Indian Ocean, and the
dry bias over the NH continental areas are notably reduced in ERA5 (typically
&lt;0.3 mm day&#8722;1) compared to ERA-Interim (typically &lt;0.5 mm
day&#8722;1). MERRA-2 shows also a relatively small dry bias over the NH
continental areas of typically &lt;0.5 mm day&#8722;1 but shows a very
pronounced wet bias in the northern high latitudes and parts of eastern Siberia
of up to about 1 mm day&#8722;1. JRA-55 shows stronger wet biases of up to
about 5 mm day&#8722;1 in the areas of deep convection in the Tropics compared
to the other reanalyses but has less pronounced dry biases. It is also clear
from Figure 3 (and Table 2) that two of the three observational datasets
(GPCP-SG and PERSIANN-CDR) are very similar. There are only very few regions
where PERSIANN-CDR shows differences compared with GPCP-SG, and these
differences are small overall (typically &lt;0.3 mm day&#8722;1). This is not
surprising since PERSIANN-CDR was bias corrected with GPCP data. WFDE5 as a
bias-corrected reanalysis dataset also shows overall relatively small biases of
typically &lt;0.5 mm day&#8722;1 compared to GPCP-SG and is therefore more
in-line with the purely observational datasets (PERSIANN-CDR and GPCC). A
pronounced pattern of alternating biases in Africa is found in WFDE5 and GPCC
that is not present in other datasets. The similarities between WFDE5 and GPCC
are not surprising since WFDE5 was bias-corrected on the basis of GPCC and CRU
data. WFDE5 offsets are the largest in data sparse terrestrial regions such as
Antarctica, pointing to the potential limitations in the bias-correction
approach employed in that product.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 3. Relative differences (bias) of the multi-year
annual means for eight datasets in % with respect to the observational dataset
GPCP-SG (reference dataset), averaged over the time period 1983–2016. Green
colors correspond to a wet bias, brown colors to a dry bias. Gray grid cells
indicate no data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.3. Histograms of Precipitation Rate Values</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition to comparing multi-year climatologies, biases,
and time series, it is helpful to analyze regions with specific precipitation
regimes separately. The regions that were selected for this analysis and their
specific precipitation characteristics are described in Section 3.2 and shown
in Figure 1.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 4 shows the frequency of occurrence for the monthly
mean precipitation rates ranging from 0 to 12 mm day&#8722;1 (left column) and
0 to 1 mm day&#8722;1 (right column) in the selected and analyzed regions. For
the calculation of the histograms shown in Figure 4, all datasets have been
regridded to the 2.5&#9702; × 2.5&#9702; grid of the GPCP-SG dataset, and
precipitation values were sampled from all months for the period 1983–2016 and
grid cells in the given region. The precipitation rates in the Tropics show in
all datasets a distribution that is strongly skewed towards very low values
&lt; 0.1 mm day&#8722;1, with higher values clearly occurring less frequently
(Figure 4, left column). As illustrated in the top right panel of Figure 4, the
lowest monthly mean precipitation values are most frequent in the
observationally-based datasets (GPCP-SG and PERSIANN-CDR) and JRA55 which has
been shown in Section 4.2 to have the highest global mean value of all datasets
analyzed here. The low precipitation rates from JRA-55 in the Tropics point
therefore to an overestimation of precipitation in other regions resulting in
an overestimation of the global mean. When zooming in on the lower value
histogram bins, it becomes clear that very small monthly mean precipitation
rates of less than 0.2 mm day&#8722;1 are underestimated in ERA5, ERA-Interim,
and MERRA-2 compared to the observations, and precipitation rates &gt; 0.5 mm
day&#8722;1 are frequently overestimated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the precipitation rate frequency distribution is
analyzed for land-only grid cells</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Figure 4, middle row), it is apparent that these values are
similarly distributed with the smaller precipitation rates being the most
frequent. The differences are small between the observational datasets and
ERA5, ERA5-Land, ERA-Interim, WFDE5, and MERRA-2.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When looking at the distribution of the precipitation rates
over ocean grid cells, the histograms reveal that the values of the lowest bin
have very similar frequencies, with the observational datasets and JRA-55 being
between 5 and 15% more frequent than ERA5, ERA-Interim, and MERRA-2. Zooming in
on the lowest precipitation rate bin, it becomes clear that small precipitation
rates of up to 0.25 mm day&#8722;1 are underestimated by ERA5 and ERA-Interim
when compared to the observations, similar to the overall tropical
precipitation rate distributions. However, for the ocean-only values, the
GPCP-SG frequencies are about 100% higher than the frequencies of ERA5 and
ERA-Interim, and frequencies of JRA-55 and PERSIANN-CDR can be up to 200%
higher. MERRA-2 shows the lowest bin frequencies similar to ERA5/ERA-Interim,
therefore underestimating the occurrence of low precipitation rates compared to
the observations. However, regarding the frequencies in the next larger bins of
low precipitation rates, MERRA-2 shows the highest values of all datasets for
ocean-only values, again similar to the distribution of ERA5/ERA-Interim. These
similarities and differences in the land-only and ocean frequencies,
respectively, point towards a systematic bias in the ERA5/ERA-Interim and
MERRA-2 datasets over tropical oceans assuming that the observations show a
realistic frequency distribution. Similar findings have been reported in a
tropical cyclone study [77]. Here, more detailed analyses of daily and
sub-daily values would be needed to better understand the possible reasons for
this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 4. Histograms of precipitation rates in the Tropics
(30&#9702; S–30&#9702; N) with no values masked (a), ocean values (b) or land
values masked (c), for the 0–12 mm day&#8722;1 range (left column) and 0–1 mm
day&#8722;1 range (right column). Histograms were calculated using monthly
values in the period 1983–2016. ERA5-Land, GPCC, and WFDE5 are available over
land only.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Interestingly, when analyzing the precipitation rate
distribution in the Pacific ITCZ region (Figure 5, upper row), a region within
the tropics with a frequent occurrence of deep convection, the distributions of
the four reanalysis datasets differ substantially. ERA5 and MERRA-2 show a
distribution closer to GPCP-SG and PERSIANN-CDR, with higher frequencies in the
lowest precipitation rate bins and roughly similar frequencies in the range
from approx. 3 to 9 mm day&#8722;1. ERA-Interim underestimates the frequency of
the lowest bins, then overestimates the frequencies in the higher bins of the
histograms. Surprisingly, and in contrast to the distribution for the entire
Tropics (Figure 4, top right panel), JRA-55 clearly underestimates the lowest
precipitation rate frequencies except the lowest bin shown in Figure 5 (top
right panel), and overestimates the precipitation rates in the higher bins. The
contribution of the 0–3 mm day&#8722;1 bin to the total precipitation in the
Tropics in JRA-55 is about 15%. The overestimation of the frequencies in the
higher bins is therefore the main reason why JRA-55 exhibits a high bias in the
average precipitation rate compared to the observations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 5. Histograms of the precipitation rate values in (a)
the Pacific ITCZ (0  N, 136&#9702; E–85&#9702; W), (b) Central Europe
(42&#9702; N–53&#9702; N, 0&#9702;–20&#9702; E), and (c) the SA Monsoon region
(5&#9702; N–30&#9702; N, 65&#9702; E–95 E) with no values masked, for the 0– 12
mm day&#8722;1 range (left column) and 0–1 mm day&#8722;1 range for the Pacific
ITCZ and SA Monsoon regions and 0–5 mm day&#8722;1 for Europe (right column).
Histograms were calculated using monthly mean values in the period 1983–2016.
ERA5-Land, GPCC, and WFDE5 are only shown in the histograms for regions without
ocean grid cells.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The precipitation frequencies for Central Europe (Figure 5,
middle row) show for all datasets a distinct peak in the frequency of the
precipitation rates at around 1.5–2.5 mm day&#8722;1. However, ERA-Interim,
GPCC, and E-OBS have their peak shifted a little more towards smaller values
(1.5–2 mm day&#8722;1) whereas JRA-55 and MERRA-2 show the peak a little more
towards higher values (2–2.5 mm day&#8722;1). ERA5, ERA5-Land, and WFDE5 follow
the distribution of GPCP-SG and PERSIANN-CDR relatively closely, both in terms
of frequencies and shape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The distribution of the SA Monsoon region is again dominated
by the frequencies in the lowest histogram bins (a pattern similar to the
distributions for the entire Tropics), and all datasets exhibit very similar
distributions. Even when zooming into the smallest histogram bin, the
distribution of the datasets is very similar, with only ERA5, ERA-interim, and
MERRA-2 showing slightly higher frequencies in the lowest bin (&lt;0.1 mm
day&#8722;1) by comparison with the observations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.4. Monthly Mean Area Averaged Time Series of Precipitation
Rates</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monthly mean area averaged time series Figures 6–8) provide
an overview of the temporal evolution of precipitation rates in the analyzed
regions. For each month in the period 1983 to 2016 the average precipitation
was calculated as an area-weighted mean for each of the analyzed datasets. In
order to allow the inclusion of the additional observational dataset TRMM-L3
which has a shorter temporal coverage than the other datasets, the monthly mean
area average time series in the Tropics was also calculated for the time period
1998 to 2013 (Figure 7).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 6. Time series of monthly mean precipitation rates
averaged over the Tropics (30&#9702; S–30&#9702; N) for the period 1983–2016.
(a) entire tropical region; (b) land-only values in the tropical region
(including ERA5-Land, GPCC and WFDE5 data); (c) ocean-only values in the
tropical region.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 6 shows the monthly mean time series averaged over
the whole Tropics (land and ocean (a)), the land-only values (b), and the
ocean-only values (c). The observational datasets GPCP-SG and PERSIANN-CDR are
very similar in all three cases with almost identical precipitation rates
(between 2.8 and 3.3 mm day&#8722;1 for the whole Tropics) and variability. For
the whole Tropics (Figure 6a) the reanalysis datasets exhibit distinctly higher
precipitation rates (between 3.3 and 4.5 mm day&#8722;1 over the course of the analyzed
time period), with JRA-55 showing the highest value of all reanalyses being up
to 35% higher than the observations. The precipitation rates for ERA5 and
ERA-Interim are very similar in magnitude between about 1998 and 2007 but they
diverge considerably before and after that time period with ERA-Interim being
up to 15% higher. ERA5 shows a weaker longterm variability with respect to its
predecessor ERA-Interim which may be attributable to several years of model and
data assimilation developments [16]. MERRA-2 shows values similar to ERA5
during most of the time period analyzed; only in the early 1990s are the
differences more pronounced (up to 0.25 mm day&#8722;1).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An analysis of tropical land-only values shows that the
differences between the datasets in the monthly mean tropical average time
series values are clearly reduced. The spread between most datasets with
respect to GPCP-SG is roughly between 10 and 25% with the exception of MERRA-2
that can be up to 50% higher than the other datasets. The spread is basically
determined by a systematic offset with the short- and long-term variability
being very similar in all dataset time series. Considering the land-only values,
the observational datasets seem to be on the lower end of the spread across the
different datasets (green lines in Figure 6b, between about 2.8 and 3.4 mm
day&#8722;1), whereas the MERRA-2 values are notably the highest among all
datasets (between about 4.2 and 4.7 mm day&#8722;1). It is also noteworthy that
the observational datasets for the whole Tropics and the land-only tropical
values are of almost of the same magnitude, i.e., in the mean approx. 3 mm
day&#8722;1. This is in very good agreement with the mean value for the Tropics
(around 3 mm day&#8722;1 for both GPCP-SG and PERSIANN-CDR) and a little higher
than the 60&#9702; S to 60&#9702; N value presented in Table 2 (around 2.9 mm
day&#8722;1 for both GPCP-SG and PERSIANN-CDR). While there is almost no difference
between the observationally based data products averaged over the whole Tropics
and the land-only tropical region, the reanalyses show a clear difference, with
the exception of MERRA-2: the overall tropical values are mostly higher than
the land-only values (3.3 to 4.5 mm day&#8722;1 and 3.3 to 3.7 mm day&#8722;1,
respectively). This was further investigated by looking also at ocean-only
values (Figure 6c) that are also higher in MERRA-2 than in the observations.
For MERRA-2, the values over land in the Tropics are slightly higher than over
oceans or the entire Tropics (up to 1 mm day&#8722;1). Overall, the results
indicate again the presence of large systematic differences between the
observational and reanalysis data time series for the whole tropical region.
These originate primarily from the precipitation values over the ocean (except
for MERRA-2), which might be a result of more observational data being
available for data assimilation over land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 7. Same as Figure 6a but for the shorter time period
1998–2013 for which TRMM-L3 data are available.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a better understanding of the differences between the
observations and reanalyses in the Tropics, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring
Mission (TRMM-L3) was used as an additional independent observational dataset.
This dataset is only available for the Tropics and the subtropics (50&#9702;
S–50&#9702; N), and the version available from obs4MIPs covers only the time
period 1998 to 2013. This is the reason why TRMM-L3 was not used in other
analyses presented here. Figure 7 shows the monthly mean precipitation rates
averaged over the whole Tropics for the shorter time period 1998 to 2013. The
TRMM-L3 dataset shows values considerably closer to the other two observational
datasets than any of the reanalyses (with a positive bias of up to 0.3 mm
day&#8722;1) supporting the earlier findings that all reanalysis datasets
analyzed here overestimate the monthly mean precipitation rates over some parts
of the tropical oceans (or the tropical land masses in the case of MERRA-2) to
some degree compared to observations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The monthly mean precipitation rates in the Pacific ITCZ
(Figure 8a) show in all datasets a higher consistency with each other (spread
smaller than 1.5 mm day&#8722;1 in most months), than is the case for the
ocean-only tropical precipitation rate values shown in Figure 6 (spread in
values about 1.5 mm day&#8722;1). However, there is still a spread between the
datasets with a clustering of the observational datasets towards the lower end,
and JRA-55 at the high end of precipitation rates (up to 12 mm day&#8722;1 in
selected months). The overall interannual variability for all the datasets is
very similar, and the clear signal of the extreme El Niño event in 1997/1998
(e.g., [78]) and a second very intense event in 2015/2016 (e.g., [20]) is
apparent in all time series.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The time series of the monthly mean precipitation rates
averaged over Central Europe (Figure 8b) show almost no differences between the
reanalysis and observational datasets (spread mostly &lt;0.3 mm day&#8722;1).
The observed precipitation rates and also the interannual variability are very
well reproduced by the reanalyses (mean, correlation, and RSMD values are very
similar for all datasets, see also Section 4.1 and Table 2), such as the strong
precipitation anomaly related to the exceptionally hot summer in 2003 in Europe
[79,80]. This high similarity between the reanalyses and observations might
have been made possible by the availability of numerous high-quality
ground-based measurements that could be assimilated in the production of the
reanalyses. The similarly well reproduced observations over the continental
U.S. (not shown here) support this suggestion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The time series of the monthly mean precipitation rates
averaged over the SA Monsoon region (Figure 8c) are dominated by a distinct
annual cycle with an amplitude of up to 10 mm day&#8722;1. All datasets show
this annual cycle with a peak in boreal summer (monsoon season) and a minimum
during boreal wintertime (dry season). The two observational datasets and the
reanalyses ERA5 and ERA-Interim show very similar values, with the reanalyses
slightly overestimating the maximum values of the average annual cycle (mostly
&lt;1 mm day&#8722;1). JRA-55, and to some extent also MERRA-2, show clearly
higher maximum values each year (up to 2 mm day&#8722;1), which is consistent
with their overall higher mean values (Table 2) and the biases described above
and shown in Figure 3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monthly mean area-averaged time series of precipitation
anomalies are presented in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 9. These were derived as monthly anomalies with
respect to the climatology of the whole time series (1983–2016) for each
individual dataset. For instance, the anomalies for ERA5 were calculated with
respect to the ERA5 long-term climatology. The anomalies are presented as a
function of time and were normalized to show the deviation from the mean as a
multiple of the standard deviation of each individual dataset. The anomaly
plots provide a good overview of the temporal evolution for the precipitation
rate time series, both for short- and long-term fluctuations, and also show how
well the individual datasets represent well-known deviations from the mean
(very dry or very wet months). Datasets that have missing values within the
region of interest (e.g., PERSIANN-CDR) were excluded from this analysis as a
distinction between land-only and ocean-only data was not done for this
analysis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 8. Times series of area averaged monthly mean
precipitation rates for (a) the Pacific ITCZ, (b) Central Europe (including
ERA5-Land, GPCC and WFDE5 data), and the (c) SA Monsoon region for the period
1983–2016.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 9 shows the anomaly time series for three regions
defined in Section 3.2, the entire Tropics (a), the Pacific ITCZ (b) and
Central Europe (c). As already seen in the analyses presented above, the
anomaly time series for the Tropics for the different datasets are markedly
different for this region. The normalized anomalies can vary by up to a factor
of two (i.e., two standard deviations), and for some periods show different
signs. In the period 2002 to 2007, ERA-Interim shows negative anomalies, whereas
ERA5 and JRA-55, and also to some extent GPCP-SG, show positive anomalies. This
spread in the anomalies between the different time series can also be seen in
the monthly mean time series (Figure 6).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anomaly time series for the Pacific ITCZ region and Central
Europe are much more consistent across the different datasets. In most cases
the anomalies from all five (for Pacific ITCZ) or nine (for Central Europe)
datasets are almost indistinguishable in Figure 9b,c. They also indicate
anomalies of similar magnitude for well-known climatic fluctuations such as,
for instance, the effects of the strong El Niño event in 1997/1998 (e.g., [78])
or 2015/2016 [20], or the exceptionally hot and dry summer in Europe in 2003
(e.g., [79]) and 2015 [81]. For these regions all reanalysis datasets describe
the temporal evolution of precipitation rates and its variability well
(differences are mostly &lt;0.1 standard deviations for Europe and &lt;0.3
standard deviations for Pacific ITCZ).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.5. Annual Cycle of Precipitation Rates</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Climatological annual cycles of all datasets calculated over
the full analyzed period</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1983–2016 are provided in Figures 10 and 11. With such
comparisons, it is possible to better assess the biases between datasets that
are caused by the underlying climatology. They also help to determine whether
biases have a specific seasonal component, or whether they are roughly constant
throughout the year, and to determine if the shape of the annual cycle is
similar among the different datasets. Similar to the analyses presented in
Sections 4.3 and 4.4, an analysis was performed for the whole Tropics and for
land-only and ocean grid cells (Figure 10), and additionally for the Pacific
ITCZ, Central Europe and SA Monsoon regions (Figure 11).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The annual cycle of precipitation rates in the Tropics
averaged over the latitude belt 30&#9702; S to 30&#9702; N is characterized by
almost no variation throughout the year. The annual cycle of the four
reanalysis datasets compare well to the two observational datasets in this
respect (annual cycle amplitude of &lt;0.2 mm day&#8722;1, Figure 10a).
However, it is again clear that the reanalyses have a bias compared to the
observations. While the annual cycle of the observations shows values between 3
mm day&#8722;1 and 3.2 mm day&#8722;1, ERA5, ERA-Interim and MERRA-2 show
values that are about 15%, 20%, or 18% higher, respectively. JRA-55 shows the
highest values for the annual cycle, almost 4.3 mm day&#8722;1, which
represents an overestimation of about 36% compared to the observations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

Tropics calculated over the period 1983–2016.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(a) entire Tropics; (b) land-only values (including
ERA5-Land, GPCC and WFDE5 data); (c) oceanonly values.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By distinguishing between land-only and ocean grid cells
when calculating the annual cycle (Figures 10b and 10c, respectively), it is
clear that the overall bias in the tropical annual cycle is caused by
deviations in the values over both land and ocean. In both cases, biases
between the observations are of similar magnitude. The annual cycle for
tropical values over land show a clear double peak in all datasets, with one
maximum around February and another around July. The biases of three of the
four reanalysis datasets are similar as for the whole Tropics: the bias for
JRA-55 is the highest, followed by the one for ERA-Interim, and the ERA5 bias
is slightly lower than for ERA-Interim. The biggest differences between the
ERA5 and ERA-Interim are found from August to December. A clear outlier for the
reanalysis datasets is MERRA-2 with values of the annual cycle up to 34% higher
than the observations, although values for the full Tropics are only about 18%
higher than the observations. Surprisingly, the observational datasets, GPCP-SG
and PERSIANN-CDR also show differences in the magnitude of their annual cycle;
this is despite these two datasets showing almost identical results in the
previous analyses. Differences between the datasets are most pronounced in the
months November to May and can reach a magnitude of up to approx. 0.5 mm
day&#8722;1. GPCC shows the lowest values for the annual cycle of all
observations and does not show the peak in February common to all other
estimates. Surprisingly, the annual cycle of the WFDE5 dataset is closer in
magnitude to ERA5 and ERA5-Land than GPCC, although it was bias-corrected based
with GPCC.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The annual cycles calculated from values over the ocean only
show almost no variations over the course of the year, and the annual cycles
from the observational datasets are almost identical. The biases between the
observations and the reanalyses are similar as for the whole tropical region,
with JRA-55 showing the highest bias. MERRA-2 shows biases even lower than ERA5
for the values averaged over ocean grid cells only.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 11 shows the precipitation rate annual cycle for the
Pacific ITCZ (a), Central</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Europe (b) and the SA Monsoon region (c). The annual cycle
for the Pacific ITCZ shows a very strong variation over the course of a year,
with a distinct maximum in June, July, and August, and a minimum in
February/March. The amplitude reaches up to 4 mm day&#8722;1 for JRA-55 and is
slightly smaller in the other datasets. While ERA5 and ERA-Interim show a very
similar shape of the annual cycle during the months June to October, ERA5 shows
lower values than ERA-Interim throughout the rest of the year. MERRA-2’s Pacific
ITCZ annual cycle shows the lowest values of all analyzed reanalysis datasets,
but with an amplitude that is slightly more pronounced than those from
observations. There is almost no difference in the annual cycles from the two
observationally based datasets. Overall, the observations show the lowest
values, with MERRA-2, ERA5, and ERA-Interim having slightly higher
climatological values, and JRA-55 again showing the largest bias of all four
reanalyses compared to the observations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The annual cycle of the different datasets for Central
Europe shows a clear double peak with a first maximum in May/June (between 2.5
and 3.1 mm day&#8722;1) and a second one in November (between 2.6 and 3.2 mm
day&#8722;1). The spread among the datasets for the annual cycles is relatively
large, spanning about 0.8 mm day&#8722;1. GPCP-SG and PERSIANN-CDR are again
very similar, but their annual cycle values are on the higher end of the spread
between datasets, showing the highest values from November to February (both
between 2.7 and 3.2 mm day&#8722;1). They are exceeded from March to June by
ERA5, ERA5-Land, and MERRA-2 by about 5 and 10%, for example in April.
Throughout the first half of the year, ERA-Interim, WFDE5, and E-OBS show the
lowest values of all the datasets (typically between 5 and 25% lower than
GPCP-SG), but in the second half of the year, ERA-Interim clearly shows the
lowest values of all analyzed datasets (between about 2.2 and 2.5 mm
day&#8722;1 during August through November). The values for the annual cycle
from WFDE5 are in most months closer to the values shown by ERA5 than GPCC,
although the bias-correction applied to WFDE5 is based on GPCC (and CRU).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The amplitude of the annual cycle in the SA Monsoon region
is the most pronounced of all the regions analyzed. The precipitation rate
values range from approx. 1 to 11 mm day&#8722;1 for JRA-55, approx. 1 to 9 mm
day&#8722;1 for MERRA-2, and from approx. 1 to 8 mm day&#8722;1 for all other
datasets. JRA-55 and MERRA-2 are the only datasets showing a distinct bias in
the annual cycle, whereas ERA5 and ERA-Interim show a very similar annual cycle
to the observations. The SA Monsoon region climatology is dominated by a
maximum precipitation rate in the months June to September, the months where
the summer monsoon rainfall connected to deep convection is triggered by a
strong land/ocean temperature contrast in this region. However, in JRA-55 the
relative bias remains relatively constant throughout the year at about 40–50%
and the relative bias in MERRA-2 shows a seasonal dependency with the bias
ranging between &#8722;5 and about 15% during December through May and about
20–30% during June through November. This compares to a relative annual mean
bias of about 20% for MERRA-2 and about 40% for JRA-55 (Table 2).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5. Summary and Conclusions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this study comparisons of precipitation rates from six
different reanalysis datasets including one bias-corrected reanalysis dataset
and five observational datasets were presented. Overall, the global mean
pattern of the precipitation rates is similar for all datasets with the most
prominent features of the global precipitation climatology being present such
as the ITCZ, the tropical warm-pool, the storm track regions, and the SPCZ.
When compared with the GPCP-SG dataset which is widely used as a precipitation
reference dataset (e.g., [5,75,76]), the reanalyses all show well-known biases
such as a wet biases over Central Africa and the Indian Ocean, the tropical and
subtropical oceans, and a dry bias over the Northern Hemisphere continental
areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Based on a range of comparisons (Sections 4.1–4.5), we
conclude that most of the analyzed reanalysis datasets have difficulties in
reproducing observed precipitation rate values over tropical oceans, especially
in the tropical Atlantic and the tropical Indian Ocean. The exception is
MERRA-2 which has problems reproducing observed precipitation rates
particularly over tropical land areas. Values over land for the other
reanalysis datasets compare well for area-averaged monthly mean time series and
frequency distribution histograms, but slightly less well for the annual cycle
climatologies. It seems therefore that the biases of most reanalysis datasets
for the whole Tropics (land and ocean) are caused by differences in the
precipitation rate values over the oceans, except for MERRA-2 where the
differences are caused by the biases over land. However, the annual cycles of
the different datasets for the Pacific ITCZ show a bias similar to the
ocean-only annual cycle: JRA-55 shows the highest bias, and while ERA5, ERA-Interim,
and MERRA-2 have a smaller bias, they still show higher values than the
observations, and both observational datasets are very similar (which is not
surprising since GPCP-SG was used to bias-correct PERSIANN-CDR).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Comparisons of the precipitation rates over Central Europe
show very good agreement in all reanalyses except for the annual cycle. For
this, some biases exist with ERA-Interim showing values that are too low from
September to November of the annual cycle but being similar to E-OBS and GPCC
during the rest of the year. GPCP-SG and PERSIANNCDR show during half of the
year the highest values of all datasets, only exceeded by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ERA5-Land (and to a lesser extent ERA5 and MERRA-2) in the
other half of the year. The very good agreement of the reanalyses with
observations for the Central European region suggests a successful assimilation
strategy of observational input data in the creation of the reanalysis
products. This finding is supported by additional comparisons of the reanalyses
for the continental U.S. (where many high-quality observations are available;
not shown here) showing that the reanalyses are in very good agreement with
observations. Maybe surprisingly, the annual cycles from WFDE5 from the
tropical land areas and for Europe are closer to ERA5 values than GPCC values,
although the bias correction is based on the latter dataset.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Overall, JRA-55 and MERRA-2 overestimate the precipitation
rates compared to observations in many regions. ERA-Interim represents the
different regions analyzed here more realistically compared to observations
than JRA-55, but not as well as ERA5. The differences in the reanalysis
datasets compared to observations could be caused by differences in
assimilation schemes, differences in assimilated datasets, but also differences
in the overall underlying model [77]. Pinning down which factor might be the most
important for each reanalysis dataset is, however, very challenging in
practice. Although biases still exist in ERA5, well-known problems such as the
wet bias over Central Africa and the Indian Ocean and the dry bias over the
Northern Hemisphere continental areas are clearly reduced compared to
ERA-Interim. In addition, the frequency distribution histograms, anomaly time
series, and annual cycle analyses for specific regions show an overall
improvement of ERA5 compared to ERA-Interim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The general global patterns of precipitation rates are
present in all datasets and are represented well (pattern correlation between
approx. 0.8 and 0.9) when compared with the observations. Observational
datasets can have a limited spatial coverage (PERSIANN-CDR, E-OBS, GPCC, and
TRMM-L3) and a limited temporal coverage (TRMM-L3) which can be a problem for
some analyses. However, the reanalyses do show biases compared to the
observations, and therefore they are also possibly not suitable for all planned
analyses or applications depending on the geographical region of interest.
Given the reported characteristics of the different reanalysis datasets that
were discussed before, there are several details worth highlighting to
potential users of these datasets:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•           ERA5 and ERA5-Land represent a clear improvement
over ERA-Interim based on the comparisons with the observations from GPCP-SG,
PERSIANN-CDR, and TRMM-L3 (Tropics only). Given also that ERA-Interim has been
discontinued, it seems good practice to use ERA5 and ERA5-Land rather than
ERA-Interim for studies requiring reanalysis data;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•           ERA5 and ERA5-Land show typically smaller biases
in precipitation than JRA-55 and MERRA-2, especially in the Pacific ITCZ and SA
Monsoon region. For the Tropics, the size of the biases differs depending on
the analyzed data subset (land- or ocean-only); • Tropical ocean precipitation
rates are highly biased in three of the four reanalyses (ERA5, ERA-Interim and
JRA-55), especially in the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•           All four reanalysis datasets with full global
coverage (ERA5, ERA-Interim, JRA-55, and MERRA-2) are close to the observations
over continental regions where many observations such as satellite and
ground-based precipitation radar are available that can be used for
assimilation in the production of the reanalysis datasets such as for Central
Europe and the continental U.S;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•           The bias correction on which the WFDE5 is based
reduced the original ERA5 values over land but did not result in WFDE5
climatologies that were significantly closer to GPCC than ERA5;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•           There are no large or fundamental differences
between ERA5 and ERA5-Land due to the fact that ERA5-Land precipitation rates
are derived from ERA5 by interpolation to the finer ERA5-Land grid [37].</p>

compared, variable-by-variable (e.g., solar radiation, Rs; air temperature,
Tair; relative humidity, RH; wind speed, u10; reference evapotranspiration,
ET0), with in situ agrometeorological observations obtained from 66 automatic weather
stations (2008–2020). In addition, the presence of a climate-dependency on

<p class=MsoNormal>New hydrological insights for the region: A general good
agreement was obtained between observed and reanalysis agrometeorological

for Tair, followed by RH, Rs, and u10 for both reanalysis datasets, especially
under temperate climate conditions. These performances were translated into
slightly higher accuracy of ET0 estimates by ERA5-Land product, confirming the
potential of using reanalysis datasets as an alternative data source for
retrieving the ET0 and overcoming the unavailability of observed
agrometeorological data.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.         Introduction </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The quantitative estimation of the evapotranspiration (ET)
fluxes exchanged within the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum is a precondition
for rational irrigation scheduling, crop yield forecasting, and hydrological
modelling applications (Hupet and Vanclooster, 2001). Nowadays, the crop
reference ET (ET0) formulation, proposed by Penman-Monteith (P-M) and
popularized by the FAO-56 paper as a reference methodology for calculating crop
water requirements (Allen et al., 1998), is still largely used for practical
purposes (Pereira et al., 2015). The use of the P-M approach calls for the
necessity of having a reliable and complete set of site-specific
agrometeorological data. In fact, the P-M approach calculates the ET0 for a
standard surface, requiring a complete set of ground-based agrometeorological
data, such as the air temperature (Tair), the wind speed (u2), the solar
radiation (Rs), and the relative humidity (RH), to parameterize the surface and
aerodynamic resistances. Commonly, agrometeorological variables are measured by
automatic weather stations. Their data integrity is ensured by proper data
quality assessment and control procedures (De Pauw et al., 2000). However,
ground-based observations could be affected by several errors, mainly due to
the sensor properties, such as their accuracy, settings, instrument drift or
temporal data sampling frequency (Beven, 1979; Hupet and Vanclooster, 2001;
Meyer et al., 1989). Other shortcomings are related to the agrometeorological
time-series consistency. The time series can suffer from substantial time gaps
(Capra et al., 2013) and often protocols for correcting and/or estimating poor
quality or missing data need to be applied (see, e.g., Pereira et al., 2015).
Moreover, the agrometeorological data representativeness of well-watered
conditions needs to be checked before implementing them in the ET0 approach
(Pereira et al., 2015). Despite the utmost importance of observed
agrometeorological data for agriculture purposes, the agrometeorological
networks are often sparse over the territory, especially in arid zones (De Pauw
et al., 2000). Sometimes, data access is another critical point for end-users
because data is managed and distributed by different regional services at the
National level (Pelosi et al., 2021). To compensate for the lack of spatial and
temporal distributed information, other weather data sources have steadily
developed, such as the use of interpolation methods from gauge-based
observations, the adoption of satellite-based datasets, or the creation of gridded
datasets obtained by adjusting the spatial interpolation estimates with
satellite observations (Pelosi et al., 2020). Moreover, during the last
century, great advances have been reached in agrometeorological data
forecasting using global and regional numerical weather prediction (NWP)
models. Several studies have already exploited their potential for supporting
sustainable irrigation management (e.g. Negm et al., 2017; Chirico et al.,
2018; Longo- Minnolo et al., 2020; Medina et al., 2018; Pelosi et al., 2016;
Vanella et al., 2020). As an example, Vanella et al. (2020) showed that the use
of forecast agrometeorological estimates provided by the Consortium for
Small-scale Modelling (COSMO, http://www.cosmo-model.org) opens promising
perspectives for assessing the ET0 in different agriculture contexts,
particularly under conditions of water scarcity, instead than using past
agrometeorological data. Besides the NWP models, the use of atmospheric
reanalysis is another alternative weather data source. Atmospheric reanalysis
has generated increasing interest in the recent decade, due to its ability to
provide complete and consistent time-series of multiple meteorological
parameters at a global scale by covering several decades (Tarek et al., 2020).
From a theoretical point of view, the reanalysis process is a retrospective
analysis of past historical data. This process makes use of the ever-increasing
computational resources, recent versions of NWP models and assimilation
schemes. In general, the reanalysis approaches assimilate a wide array of
atmospheric and ocean measured and remotely sensed information within a
dynamical–physical coupled numerical model (Poli et al., 2016). One of the
recognized advantages of using reanalysis approaches is that their outputs are
not directly dependent on the density of ground-based observational networks.
Thus they have the potential to provide variables in areas with little and/or
no surface coverage (Tarek et al., 2020). Moreover, Pelosi et al. (2020)
reported that reanalysis data can represent an efficient data source for
planning and design studies applied to irrigation water management. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Currently, several modelling centres provide reanalysis
products at variable spatial and temporal scales (Lindsay et al., 2014;
Chaudhuri et al., 2013). As an example, the European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) periodically applies its forecast models and data
assimilation systems to reanalyse archived observations for generating global
data sets describing the recent history of the atmosphere, land surface, and
oceans. The latest released ECMWF reanalysis products are ERA5 single levels
(ERA5) and ERA5 Land (ERA5-L), which are being produced within the Copernicus
Climate Change Service and freely distributed since 2019. The first dataset,
ERA5, covers the entire globe from 1979 at a spatial resolution of about 30 km
(depending on latitude). The second dataset, ERA5-L, has been produced by
replaying the land component of the ERA5 climate reanalysis, with a horizontal
spatial resolution of 9 km. Specifically, ERA5-L uses air temperature (Tair),
air humidity and air pressure, in a process of atmospheric forcing, as input to
control the simulated land fields. These atmospheric variables are corrected to
account for the altitude difference between the grid of the forcing and the
higher resolution grid of ERA5-L (Munoz-Sabater, 2019˜ ). A comprehensive
review of the state-of-the-art associated with the use of ERA5-L for land and
environmental applications is presented by Munoz-Sabater et al. (2021)˜ . They
demonstrated the added value of ERA5-L reanalysis products, in comparison to
ERA-Interim and ERA5, for estimating a wide range of in situ observations, even
if they have not evaluated the performance of the reanalysis products in
predicting ET fluxes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The specific objective of this study was to explore the
effectiveness of using the most advanced global ECMWF reanalysis data (ERA5
single levels and ERA5-L) as a potential data source for predicting the main
agrometeorological variables and estimating the ET0 in different climate
contexts within the Italian territory, at daily and seasonal scales. In
addition, visual Geographic Information System (GIS) based user-friendly tools
have been developed in this study for guiding the users in the reanalyses data pre-processing
steps. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.         Materials and methods </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The methodological approach proposed in this study was
carried out in the framework of the research project INtegrated Computer
modeling and monitoring for Irrigation Planning in Italy (INCIPIT). The general
aim of the INCIPIT project is to identify a shared set of modelling tools and
monitoring techniques for the assessment of irrigation water uses in seven
irrigation districts distributed over the Italian territory. In this context,
time series of daily values of the agrometeorological variables registered in
66 weather stations, referred to as the INCIPIT irrigation districts (Table 1
and Fig. 1), were collected. The use of the new generation ECMWF reanalysis
datasets was then evaluated in comparison to the retrieved ground-based
agrometeorological data for the ET0 estimation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.1.      Ground-based agrometeorological variables at the
study sites </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The observed agrometeorological data was acquired on a daily
scale from 66 weather stations located in six different Italian administrative
regions (Campania, Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy, Apulia, Sardinia, and Sicily),
within the reference period 2008–2020 (from January 1st 2008 to December 31st
2020). Due to the trans-regional component of this study, the observed
agrometeorological data were provided from multiple ground-based sources
managed by different Regional meteorological agencies located in each of the
irrigation districts of interest (Fig. 1 and Table 1). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The set of agrometeorological variables under investigation
was composed of solar radiation (Rs, W m-2), maximum and minimum Tair measured
at 2 m (&#9702;C), maximum and minimum relative humidity (RH, %), wind speed
measured at 2 m (u2, m s-1) and 10 m (u10, m s-1), respectively, and ET0
estimates calculated with the P-M approach (mm d-1). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The selection of the weather stations was based on a twofold
criterion. Firstly, they were identified by setting a maximum distance (50 km)
between the centroid of each of the 7 irrigation districts under study (whose
coordinates are reported in Table 1) and the candidate weather stations.
Secondly, the selection was refined based on the temporal consistency (i.e.
continuous time series) and completeness (i.e. the complete set of data) of the
available agrometeorological series. Under these criteria, more than 50 million
records were acquired from 66 weather stations, covering a great range of
climatic conditions, mainly in terms of the different irrigation district
geographic locations (i.e., northern, central and insular Italy) and elevation
features (Table 1). Note that the available dataset for Sardinia sites was only
composed of the ET0 estimates. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In particular, under the improved Koppen-Geiger
classification, recently provided at 1-km resolution by ¨      Beck et al.
(2018), a number of 7 weather stations located in Apulia are characterized by
arid, steppe, cold climate (BSk); 24 sites, placed in Campania, Sicily (Eastern
and Western part) and Sardinia, are featured by dry and hot-summer temperate
climate (Csa); and 32 sites, located in Emilia-Romagna and Lombardy, are
referred to no dry season, hot summer temperate climate conditions (Cfa). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The quality of the ground-based data was checked according
to the procedure proposed in Allen (1996). Daily ground-based data was
aggregated in 4 periods for seasonality analyses on the astronomical basis, as
follows: winter (1st January–19th March and 21st-31st December), spring (20th
March–20th June), summer (21st June– 22nd September), and autumn (23rd
September–20th December). </p>

main technical details of these reanalysis datasets are reported in Table 2. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ERA5 dataset is the 5th generation of ECMWF global
reanalysis succeeding ERA-Interim and covering the entire globe from 1979, at a
spatial resolution of about 30 km. The ERA5-L dataset is generated for the
entire globe with a native horizontal resolution of about 9 km (released on a
regular 0.1&#9702; x 0.1&#9702; grid) by replaying the land component of ERA5
climate reanalysis, from 1981 to 2–3 </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>months before the present. Specifically, the atmospheric
forcing in ERA5-L is provided by land fields of ERA5 atmospheric variables. In
ERA5, Tair, air humidity and air pressure are corrected to account for the
elevation difference between the grid of the forcing and the higher-resolution
grid of ERA5-L, according to the so-called lapse rate correction
(Munoz-Sabater, 2019˜ ). Although ERA5-L runs at the enhanced spatial
resolution, there is a limit that data are not provided for numerical grid
points falling on the sea surface or in the proximity of the coastline (Pelosi
et al., 2020). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ERA5 and ERA5-L reanalysis datasets were freely
downloaded from the Climate Change Service Copernicus platform (https://
cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/search?type=dataset) through the Climate
Data Store web interface v.1.0 in Network common data form (NetCDF) format for
the entire Italian domain (1221.79 ×916.46 km), as for the ground-based
observations, within the reference period 2008–2020. The hourly
agrometeorological variables of interest were: the Tair (’2m_temperature’, t2m,
&#9702;C) and the dew point temperatures (Tdew, named as
’2m_dewpoint_temperature d2m, m s-1’); the Rs
(’surface_solar_radiation_downwards’, ssrd, J m-2) and; the vertical and
horizontal component of the wind speed (’10m_u_component_of_wind’, U10, m s-1,
and ’10m_v_component_of_wind’, V10, m s-1). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.3.1.   Data pre-processing steps </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both hourly ERA5 single levels and ERA5-L data were
aggregated at a daily time step to be compared variable-by-variable with the
ground-based observations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The daily minimum and maximum Tair and Tdew values were
obtained from the hourly data. The daily Tair comparisons were carried out
considering the average of the daily maximum (Tmax) and minimum temperatures
(Tmin). The daily Rs values were aggregated on 24 h basis. The daily RH was
calculated as the ratio between the actual (ea) and the saturation (eo(T))
vapour pressure using the average Tair and Tdew derived on 24 h basis as
inputs, according to the formula proposed in Allen et al. (1998): </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ea</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>e (T) = 0.6108 • exp    (3) o    Tair + 237.3</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The daily wind speed at 10 m (u10, m s-1) was calculated
using the horizontal and vertical components (V10 and U10) retrieved by ERA5
and ERA5-L datasets, as reported in Allen et al. (1998). Note that the wind
speed comparison between the ground-based and reanalysis observations was
performed on the u10 basis. The wind speed at 2 m (u2) was rescaled, from the
logarithmic wind profile, for being used as input in the ET0 calculation using
the P-M approach (see Section 2.3). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The above-mentioned reanalysis datasets data pre-processing
steps were performed using five ad hoc GIS-based toolboxes developed in ArcPy
(ESRI©) (see “Supplementary materials” section). The reanalysis post-processed
data were extracted from the overall domain at the weather stations’ location
variable-by-variable (Fig. 1). Finally, as for the daily ground-based data, the
reanalysis data were aggregated in four periods for seasonality analyses using
the same time step as used for the ground-based data. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.4.      Calculating daily ET0 estimates </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although ERA5 single levels and ERA5-L provide potential
evapotranspiration data (ETp), this variable is conceptually different from ET0
estimates as defined in the FAO-56 paper (Allen et al., 1998). In particular,
ETp is computed in ERA5 based on surface energy balance calculations with the
vegetation parameters set to &quot;crops/mixed farming&quot; and assuming
&quot;no stress from soil moisture&quot; (Hersbach et al., 2018), whereas, ETp
in ERA5-L is computed as open water evaporation assuming that the atmosphere is
not affected by the artificial surface condition (Munoz 2019). Thus, in this
study daily ET˜ 0 estimates were obtained by implementing the reanalysis of
agrometeorological data through the Penman-Monteith (PM) method (Penman, 1956;
Monteith, 1965), as follows: </p>

the time step, the reference crop type and daytime/night- time ratio; T is the

such as the slope of the regression line forced by the origin; the coefficient

error (BIAS; Eq. 6); the mean absolute error (MAE; Eq. 7), and the normalized
root-mean-square error (NRMSE; Eq. 8); calculated as follows: </p>

respectively, Oi is the observed value from the ground-based agrometeorological
stations, where &#770;S and O &#770; are the averages of the data arrays of Si
and Oi, and n is the number of observations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The difference in reproducing the agrometeorological
variables by ERA5 and ERA5-L products, respectively, was assessed by applying
the least-squares linear regression method and by comparing the outputs of the
regression lines in terms of slope (for p-values &lt; 0.05). This statistical
analysis was conducted using the R software (R Core team, 2020). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The evaluation of the topographic effect on the
agrometeorological variables obtained by the reanalysis datasets was assessed
by comparing the elevation of the selected weather stations (Table 1) with the
average elevation observed at the cell-size of the ERA5 single levels and
ERA5-L datasets (30 and 9 km), respectively (see “Supplementary materials”
section). In particular, the main zonal statistics (count, mean, minimum,
maximum, standard deviation, and median values) of the elevation values were
extracted at the level of the cell containing the weather stations (Table 1)
from a digital elevation model, with a spatial resolution of 75 m, released by
the Italian Ministry of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and

<p class=MsoNormal>3.1.      Agrometeorological variable-by-variable
comparisons </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The description of the main results obtained by comparing
the ERA5 and ERA5-L reanalysis agrometeorological estimates (Tair, Rs, u2, RH
and ET0), respectively, and the relative ground-based variables are reported
hereafter variable-by-variable for the irrigation districts under study (Table
1), referring to the period 2008–2020. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The overall performance (in terms of RMSE, MAE, PBIAS and
NRMSE values) of the comparisons are given in Tables 3 and 4 at the different
explored time scales (daily and seasonal). Note that Sardinia sites are not
included in Tables 3 and 4 because no data was available. Figs. 2–6 report the
scatterplots outputted by comparing the daily ERA5 and ERA5-L estimates,
respectively, versus the observed variables for the irrigation districts under
study, as well as the parameters of the regression analyses (b and R2). </p>

(ET0_ERA5 and ET0_ERA5-L, mm d-1) versus observed (ET0_Obs, mm d-1) values at
the irrigation districts located in Lombardy (a, h), Emilia-Romagna (b, i);
Campania (c, j), Western Sicily (d, k), Eastern Sicily (e, l), Sardinia (f, m)
and Apulia (g, n) for the period 2008–2020. The black and red lines represent
the 1:1 and the linear regression line through the origin, respectively. The

coefficient of determination and the number of observations, respectively. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In general, the results of the least-squares linear
regression analysis carried out to compare the daily reanalysis datasets (i.e.,
ERA5 and ERA5-L) versus the observed agrometeorological data showed significant
differences in terms of slopes values for all the variables of interest also at
the seasonal level. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.1.1.   Air temperature (Tair) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.1.1.1. Tair: ERA5 versus ground-observations. Daily
average Tair values were estimated with good accuracy by the ERA5 reanalysis
dataset at all the irrigation districts under study (Table 3), showing average
RMSE values of 1.46 &#9702;C, 1.70 &#9702;C and 1.76 &#9702;C; and MAE values
of 1.15 &#9702;C, 1.29 &#9702;C and 1.42 &#9702;C under Bsk, Cfa and Csa
climate conditions, respectively. The average values of NRMSE varied between
0.09 and 0.14; reaching minimum and maximum values under Bsk and Csa-Cfa
climate conditions, respectively. The PBIAS values varied from 0.38% (in
Eastern Sicily study sites) to 6.62% (in Emilia-Romagna study sites) and
&#8722; 9.22% (in Campania study sites); showing average values of &#8722;
2.12%, 3.12% and 4.14% under Csa, Cfa and Bsk climate conditions, respectively,
with average R2 values varying between 0.94 (Csa) and 0.97 (Bsk). The slope
values (b) ranged from 0.91 to 1.04, indicating a site-specific underestimation
of 9% and overestimation of 4% in Campania and Emilia-Romagna study sites,
respectively (Fig. 2a-f). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On a seasonal basis, the best Tair performance was observed
in autumn, showing average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values of 1.61 &#9702;C,
1.27 &#9702;C, 2.64%, 1.01 and 0.89, respectively. Similar performances were
obtained in spring-summer seasons (with average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2
values of 1.72 &#9702;C, 1.35 &#9702;C, &#8722; 0.62%, 0.99 and 0.79,
respectively), while a slightly lower accuracy was observed in winter (with
average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values of 1.70 &#9702;C, 1.34 &#9702;C,
5.14%, 1.00 and 0.72, respectively). The same trend was observed in terms of
NRMSE values. Specifically, the Tair predictions reached the best performance
in Apulia study sites during winter and summer (with RMSE and MAE values of
1.35 and 1.08 &#9702;C, respectively), followed by spring and autumn in Eastern
Sicily and Lombardy study sites; whereas the lowest Tair performance was
obtained in Campania study sites during all seasons (Table 3). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.1.1.2. Tair: ERA5-L versus ground-observations. Daily
average Tair values were predicted with acceptable accuracy by the ERA-L
reanalysis dataset at all the irrigation districts under study (Table 4),
resulting in average RMSE values of 1.76 &#9702;C, 1.82 &#9702;C and 1.97
&#9702;C; and MAE values of 1.44 &#9702;C, 1.39 &#9702;C and 1.44 &#9702;C
under Csa, Cfa and Bsk climate conditions, respectively. The average NRMSE
values varied between 0.08 and 0.16; with similar values under Csa, Cfa and Bsk
climate conditions The PBIAS values ranged between 1.35% (in Emilia-Romagna
study sites) to &#8722; 11.75% (in Campania study sites); showing average
values of &#8722; 4.87%, &#8722; 2.38% and 2.46% in Csa, Cfa and Bsk climate
conditions, respectively. The average R2 values ranged from 0.93 (Csa) to 0.95
(Cfa and Bsk); and the slope values (b) ranged from 0.89 to 0.99, indicating a
maximum and minimum underestimation of 11% and 1% in Campania and
Emilia-Romagna study sites, respectively (Fig. 2g-l). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Seasonally greater Tair predictions were retrieved in summer
and autumn seasons, resulting in average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values of
1.73 &#9702;C, 1.36 &#9702;C, &#8722; 2.39%, 0.97 and 0.81, respectively;
whereas, slightly lower Tair performance were observed in spring and winter
seasons, showing average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values of 1.89 &#9702;C,
1.48 &#9702;C, &#8722; 5.38%, 0.93 and 0.80, respectively. A similar trend was
observed in terms of NRMSE values. Specifically, the Tair predictions reached
the best performance at Eastern Sicily study sites during spring and
autumn-winter periods (with average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values of 1.28
&#9702;C, 1.02 &#9702;C, &#8722; 1.31%, 0.98 and 0.92, respectively) and in
summer in Western Sicily study sites (Table 4); whereas the lowest Tair
performance was obtained in Campania study sites during all seasons (Table 4). </p>

conditions (Table 3), showing average RMSE values of 32.27 W m-2, 32.43 W m-2,
and 45.03 W m-2; MAE of 23.67 W m-2, 24.20 W m-2 and 30.72 W m-2, and NRMSE of
0.17, 0.21 and 0.24 in Csa, Cfa and Bsk, respectively. Average PBIAS values
ranged between 0.83% (Cfa) to 2.93% (Csa) and &#8722; 5.21% (Bsk),
corresponding to R2 values of 0.88, 0.86 and 0.80, respectively. The slope
terms (b) presented the same trend with values from 1.00 to 0.96 and 0.91 under
Csa, Cfa and Bsk climate conditions, respectively. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Seasonally, the best Rs performance was retrieved in autumn
(with average RMSE, MAE and PBIAS values of 27.36 W m-2, 20.34 W m-2, and
1.93%, respectively; and b and R2 terms of 0.88 and 0.67, respectively) at all
site locations (except for Campania locations), followed by winter and summer.
Slightly lower Rs performance was obtained in spring, resulting in average
RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values of 43.17 W m-2, 32.09 W m-2, 2.20%, 0.96 and
0.48, respectively. In absolute terms, the best Rs predictions were reached in
Western Sicily study sites during summer (also in terms of NRMSE values) and in
Emilia-Romagna study sites for the other seasons (Table 3); whereas the lowest
Rs performance was obtained in Bsk climate condition (Apulia study sites)
during all seasons and in Campania sites for the autumn season in terms of
NRMSE (Table 3). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.1.2.2. Rs: ERA5-L versus ground-observations. Daily Rs
values were predicted with good accuracy by the ERA5-L reanalysis dataset at
all study sites (Table 4), resulting in average RMSE values of 32.53 W m-2,
34.33 W m-2 and 44.98 W m-2, and NRMSE values of 0.17, 0.21 and 0.24 under Csa,
Cfa and Bsk climate conditions, respectively. Average MAE values ranged from
23.87 W m-2 (Csa) to 25.06 W m-2 (Cfa) and 30.67 W m-2 (Bsk); and PBIAS values
varied between 0.96% (Cfa) to 3.09% (Csa) and &#8722; 5.29% (Bsk). The R2
values and slope terms (b) varied from 0.80 to 0.86 and 0.87, and from 0.91 to
0.96 and 1.00, under Bsk, Csa and Cfa climate conditions, respectively (Fig.
3g-l). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the seasonal level, the Rs predictions reached the best
performance in autumn at all climate conditions (except for Campania locations
also in terms of NRMSE), with average RMSE, MAE and PBIAS values of 27.96 W
m-2, 20.73 W m-2, and 2.02%, respectively; and b and R2 terms of 0.92 and 0.65.
The lower performance was observed in spring under all climate conditions, with
average RMSE, MAE and PBIAS values of 44.23 W m-2, 32.57 W m-2, and 2.35%,
respectively; and b and R2 terms of 0.98 and 0.46, respectively. (Table 4).
Intermediate Rs performances were observed in winter and summer (Table 4).
Partially different results were observed in terms of NRMSE showing greater
performances in summer followed by spring and winter-autumn seasons. The Rs
predictions reached the best performance in Western Sicily during spring and
summer periods (Table 4) and in autumn and winter seasons under Cfa climate
conditions (Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna study sites); whereas the lowest Rs
performance was obtained under Bsk climate condition (Apulia study sites)
during all seasons also in terms of NRMSE values (Table 4). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.1.3.1. u10: ERA5 versus ground-observations. The
performances of the ERA5 dataset in predicting daily u10 values are shown in
Table 3 and Fig. 4a-f. The ERA5 accuracy shows a specific pattern as a function
of the climate conditions, resulting in average RMSE values of 1.04 m s-1, 1.21
m s-1 and 1.57 m s-1 under Cfa, Csa, and Bsk climate conditions, respectively.
Similar behaviour is observed in terms of average MAE values, ranging from 0.73
m s-1 (Cfa) to 0.91 m s-1 (Csa) and 1.17 m s-1 (Bsk). Inversely, PBIAS values
were equal to &#8722; 19.43%, &#8722; 20.54%, and &#8722; 25.21% from Bsk to
Csa and Cfa climate conditions, respectively. Lower R2 values were obtained at
all study sites, with b terms ranging from 0.66 and 0.74 in Cfa-Bsk and Csa
climate conditions, respectively. A similar trend was observed in terms of
NRMSE values. </p>

to 0.62 and 0.52, under Bsk, Cfa and Csa climate conditions, respectively. The
slope terms (b) ranged from 0.58 (Cfa) to 0.64 (Bsk) and 0.72 (Csa), indicating
an underestimation varying from 28% to 36% and 42%, under Csa, Bsk and Cfa
climate conditions, respectively. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the seasonal level, the u10 predictions reached the best
performance in autumn, with average RMSE, MAE and PBIAS values of 1.34 m s-1,
1.01 m s-1, and &#8722; 20.79%, respectively; and b and R2 terms of 0.68 and
0.26, respectively. Lower performance was observed in winter, resulting in
average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values of 1.47 m s-1, 1.11 m s-1, &#8722;
23.86%, 0.70 and 0.32, respectively. Moderate u10 performances were observed in
the other seasons (Table 4). Slight differences were observed in terms of NRMSE
values. Specifically, the u10 predictions reached the best and worst
performance at Lombardy and Apulia study sites, respectively, during all
seasons (Table 4). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.1.4.   Relative humidity (RH) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.1.4.1. RH: ERA5 versus ground-observations. Good accuracy
was observed in the estimation of daily RH values by ERA5 at all study sites
(Table 3), resulting in a similar trend of RMSE and MAE, with values of these
indicators ranging from 8.78% to 9.55% and 19.02%, and from 6.88% to 7.47% and
15.30% under Cfa, Csa and Bsk climate conditions, respectively. Similar
behaviour was observed in terms of NRMSE, PBIAS and b values, showing better
performances from Cfa to Csa and Bsk climates (Fig. 5a-f). The slope terms and
R2 values ranged from 0.81 to 1.04, and from 0.34 to 0.66, respectively. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On a seasonal basis, the ERA5 accuracy was better in autumn
and winter (average RMSE, MAE and NMRSE values of 10.07%, 8.06% and 0.13),
followed by spring and summer seasons (average RMSE, MAE and NMRSE values of
11.23%, 8.96% and 0.16, respectively). In particular, the best ERA5 performance
was retrieved at Campania (spring-summer), Lombardy (autumn) and Western Sicily
(winter) study sites. Lower accuracy was obtained at Apulia study sites for all
seasons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.1.4.2. RH: ERA5-L versus ground-observations. The daily RH
estimates predicted by ERA5-L in comparison to the ground-based measurements
resulted in RMSE values ranging between 9.63% and 9.82% under Cfa and Csa
climate conditions, respectively, reaching 15.98% in Bsk conditions (Fig.
5g-l). Similar trend was observed in terms of NRMSE values. This behaviour
resulted in MAE and PBIAS values of 7.57%, 7.85%, 12.03% and 5.55%, 7.66%,
&#8722; 11.92% under Cfa, Csa and Bsk conditions, respectively. Similar trends
were observed for the b and R2 terms, showing values of 1.04–1.06 and 0.86 and
0.41–0.52 and 0.27 under Cfa-Csa and Bsk conditions, with overestimation of
4–6% in Cfa and Csa and underestimation of 14% at Apulia study site (Bsk). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the seasonal level, the overall best RH performance was
observed in autumn (Table 4), with average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS and NRMSE values of
10.24%, 8.17%, 3.07% and 0.13, respectively. Similar performances were
retrieved in winter and spring, with slightly lower ERA5-L accuracy during
summer (Table 4). Specifically, the best performance was observed at Campania
(in summer) and Lombardy study sites (in the other seasons); whereas lower
performance at Emilia-Romagna (in winter) and Apulia study sites (in the other
seasons) (Table 4). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.1.5.   Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.1.5.1. ET0: ERA5 versus ground-observations. Daily ET0
estimates obtained using as inputs the agrometeorological information provided
by the ERA5 dataset showed good accuracy in comparison to the ground-based ET0
estimates (Table 5 and Fig. 6a-m). In particular, the daily ET0 estimates
reached the best performance under Csa-Cfa climate conditions (with average
RMSE, MAE and NRMSE values of 0.66 mm d-1, 0.48 mm d-1, and 0.23,
respectively). Lower performance was observed at Bsk, resulting in average RMSE,
MAE and NRMSE values of 0.90 mm d-1, 0.67 mm d-1, and 0.31, respectively.
Positive average PBIAS values were obtained at Bsk (7.90%), whereas negative
average PBIAS values of &#8722; 4.25% and &#8722; 9.64% resulted under Csa and
Cfa climate conditions. At the seasonal level, the ET0 performance was greater
during winter and autumn periods (with average RMSE, MAE, BIAS, b and R2 values
of 0.47 mm d-1, 0.34 mm d-1, 1.98%, 0.93 and 0.58, respectively), and lower,
but still satisfactory, in spring and summer (with average RMSE, MAE, BIAS, b
and R2 values of 0.85 mm d-1, 0.67 mm d-1, &#8722; 5.58%, 0.93 and 0.59,
respectively). Similar values were observed in terms of NRMSE values among the
seasons (Table 5). Better accuracy was obtained at Lombardy (winter-autumn
seasons), Campania (summer) and Eastern Sicily (spring) study sites; whereas,
lower accuracy was reached at Apulia study sites for all seasons (Table 5). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.1.5.2. ET0: ERA5-L versus ground-observations. Overall,
ERA5-L provided daily ET0 estimates with good accuracy (Table 5 and Fig. 6h-n).
Specifically, the daily ET0 estimates reached the best performance under Csa
and Cfa conditions (with average RMSE, MAE and NRMSE values of 0.63 mm d-1,
0.46 mm d-1 and 0.22, respectively) (Table 5 and Fig. 6h-n). The lower
performance was observed at Bsk, with average RMSE, MAE and NRMSE values of
0.88 mm d-1, 0.64 mm d-1 and 0.30, respectively. Positive average PBIAS values
were obtained under Bsk (5.86%); whereas under Csa and Cfa climate conditions
resulted in values ranging from &#8722; 2.53% to &#8722; 10.81%, respectively. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the seasonal level, the ET0 performance resulted better
in winter and autumn (with average RMSE, MAE, BIAS, b and R2 values of 0.50 mm
d-1, 0.36 mm d-1, &#8722; 3.84%, 0.90 and 0.64, respectively), and lower, but
still quite satisfactory, in spring and summer (with average RMSE, MAE, BIAS, b
and R2 values of 0.77 mm d-1, 0.60 mm d-1, &#8722; 3.53%, 0.94 and 0.63,
respectively). As for the ERA5, similar values were observed in terms of NRMSE
values among the seasons (Table 5). Greater accuracy was obtained at Lombardy
(winter-autumn seasons) and Western Sicily (spring-summer seasons) study sites,
while lower accuracy was obtained at Apulia study sites for all seasons (Table
5). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.         Discussion </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Climate reanalysis data have been widely used for
hydrological and meteorological applications. However, it is still difficult to
quantitatively estimate their accuracy due to their variability both at spatial
and temporal scales, especially under complex topography and pronounced
climatic heterogeneity (i.e., the rainfall) (Jiao et al., 2021). Often, ground
variables are taken into account in the reanalysis process (such as air
pressure, Tair, RH and u10) to improve the reanalysis data quality. However, if
the data assimilation approach can improve data accuracy, by adding physically
meaningful information from the predictive model, this is still subject to
uncertainty. The main sources of uncertainty are due to numerical simulations,
assimilation schemes and errors associated with the observation systems (Dee et
al., 2011). In this sense, some studies showed that it is difficult to
completely replace observational data with reanalysis information for
describing the true state of the atmosphere (Bengtsson et al., 2004), e.g., for
long-term climate trend studies (Liu et al., 2018) and/or for capturing
seasonal and inter-annual changes (Jiao et al., 2021). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This study explored the potential of using the new released
ECMWF climate reanalysis datasets (i.e., ERA5 and ERA5-L) for proving daily and
seasonal agrometeorological information (Tair, Rs, RH, u10 and ET0) by
determining their performance against measured ground-based observations within
the Italian territory in the reference period 2008 – 2020. Moreover, since new
user requirements are constantly emerging in society (Munoz-Sabater et al.,
2021˜ ), ad hoc user-interfaces GIS-based user-friendly tools have been
developed in this study for supporting the needs of a diverse set of users,
next to the climate and weather research motivations, within the reanalysis
data pre-processing steps (Fig. 1.S-4. S). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Herein, a generally good agreement was observed between the
ability of ERA5 and ERA5-L products in reproducing the agrometeorological
variables of interest (commonly used for ET calculation) in comparison to the
ground-based observations collected at 66 study sites distributed over 7
irrigation districts. Specifically, the daily Tair estimates offered the most
accurate reanalysis predictions, followed by the RH, Rs, and u10 variables,
which still provided satisfactory results (Tables 3–4, Figs. 3–5). Similar
(i.e., for RH) or slightly improved statistical metrics were obtained by ERA5
in comparison to ERA5-L (i.e., showing lower RMSE values than ERA5- L, for Tair
and Rs, respectively, in 67% and 83% of the total number of the investigated
irrigation districts). This can be attributed to the fact these variables are
more homogeneous at the spatial scales provided by ERA5 products in comparison
to ERA5-L (Fig. 5. S in Supplementary materials section). The u10 performance
was always more consistent for ERA5 than ERA5-L in comparison to the
observations at all irrigation districts, most likely because ERA5-L does not
consider the influence of the sea surface in its products (Munoz-Sabater, 2019˜
). Altogether, the daily Tair, Rs, RH, and u10 estimates were more accurate
during the autumn season for both reanalysis datasets (Tables 3–4). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The influence of topographic features on the accuracy of the
reanalysis data was also investigated, following the evidence that it could be
significant provided by previous studies. For example, Gao and Hao (2014)
evaluated the relationship existing between the elevation of the climate
reanalysis data from ERA-Interim and the observed station’s elevation. These
authors pointed out that differences in elevation can affect the accuracy of
the reanalysis data, especially in areas with relatively higher altitudes.
Analogous considerations are reported by Longo-Minnolo et al. (2022) for a
Sicilian watershed, with elevation values ranging between 0 and 3313 m a.s.l.,
for which the highest RMSE values were observed in the ERA5-L cells with
relatively higher variations in altitude. To overcome these shortcomings in
mountainous areas, other authors suggest applying altitude correction
procedures, especially for water vapour, precipitation and Tair estimates (Zhao
et al., 2008; Feng et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2013; Negm et al., 2018). For
altitudes below 1000 m (a.s.l.), however, Jiao et al. (2021) found a good
agreement between climate reanalysis and observational data. Similar results
emerged from this study, where no specific relationships were obtained between
the elevation changes and the goodness of reanalysis datasets in reproducing
the agrometeorological variables of interest, at the site-by-site scale, within
the seven irrigation districts under investigation (Table 1). These findings
show that the accuracy of the reanalyses products is strongly connected with
the climatic conditions rather than the topographic distribution of the
selected study sites. Due to the above-mentioned explanations and for
maintaining the integrity of the reanalysis datasets, no topography corrections
were applied in this study. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The performance of reanalysis data strongly depends on the
different climate conditions characterizing the investigated sites, as shown by
Tarek et al. (2020). Specifically, these authors observed that Tair and
precipitation estimated by ERA5 are systematically more performant in
comparison to ERA-Interim at all the 13 Northern America climate zones under
study. In addition, they reported that in situ measurements are higher than
ERA5 for Cfa and hot-summer humid continental (Dfa) climate zones; elsewhere, these
differences are less pronounced. In this sense, they did not experience the
difference in hydrological modelling performance using both ERA5 products and
observations over 9 of the 13 climate zones. For the remaining regions (Bsk,
Cfa, Dfa, and warm-summer humid continental climate, Dfb), the use of
observations resulted in improved hydrological modelling performance. In
agreement with Tarek et al. (2020), in our study site-specific performance
depended on the different investigated climate conditions (Table 1). In
particular, the major part of the variables of interest (Rs, RH, u10 and ET0)
resulted in greater and lower performance under Csa and Bks climate conditions,
respectively, by both reanalysis datasets, except for Tair estimates provided
by ERA5 that shows an inverted pattern due to the influence of the sea
temperature in this product (Hersbach et al., 2020). Intermediate performance
was observed under Cfa climate zones. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The good quality of the reanalysis data was translated into
reliable daily and seasonal ET0 estimates (with an underestimation from 2 up to
13% for the climate classes under study). Specifically, as for the other
variables, ET0 estimates were more accurate in autumn/ winter than in
spring/summer by both reanalysis datasets in terms of RMSE values (Table 5 and
Fig. 6). In addition, ERA5-L reproduces with greater accuracy and higher
spatial resolution the ET0 observations at most of the study sites even under
different climate conditions, i.e., showing lower RMSE values than ERA5 in 86%
of the total number of the irrigation districts under study. Thus, the high
accuracy obtained in this study when estimating ET0 by reanalysis products
(resulting in RMSE and NRMSE values ranging between 0.57 and 0.90 mm d-1 and
from 0.17 to 0.31, respectively) suggests the potential use of this information
for calculating the daily crop evapotranspiration rates aiming at supporting
the irrigation scheduling. In this sense, Rolle et al. (2021) have recently
estimated the global irrigation requirement of 26 crops by implementing the
Hargreaves-Samani method (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) to calculate ET0, by
using information on Tair and Rs retrieved by the ERA5 dataset. Other studies
assessed the use of a blended set of weather input data composed of ERA5-L
outputs and different sources of climate data (i.e., reanalysis data and
satellite-based radiation data) to evaluate the ET0 for the Campania region
(Pelosi et al., 2020; Pelosi and Chirico, 2021). Pelosi et al. (2021) combined
the ERA5-L products with multispectral satellite imagery for estimating the
past crop evapotranspiration. Under this scenario, the results of the present
study may contribute to the informed use of reanalysis data in water management
applications in Italy and elsewhere. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5.         Conclusion </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This study explores the performance of the ERA5 single
levels and ERA5-L in depicting the agrometeorological data from 2008 to 2020 in
comparison to observational data measured at 66 sites distributed over 7
irrigation districts over the Italian territory. Specifically, the main
findings that can be drawn from this study are the following:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>–          the daily average Tair estimates offered the most
accurate reanalysis predictions, followed by RH, Rs, and u10 variables. This
was translated into reliable daily ET0 estimates resulting in RMSE and NRMSE
values ranging between 0.57 and 0.90 mm d-1 and from 0.17 to 0.31,
respectively;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>–          similar or slightly improved statistical metrics
were obtained by ERA5 in comparison to ERA5-L in estimating RH, Tair and Rs;
whereas the u10 and ET0 performances were more consistent by ERA5 and ERA5-L,
respectively, when compared to the observations at the majority of the
irrigation districts under study;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>–          the Rs, RH, u10 and ET0 estimates resulted in
higher and lower performance under Csa and Bks climate conditions,
respectively, by both reanalysis datasets; conversely, a reverse pattern was
obtained for Tair estimates provided by ERA5, being more accurate under Bsk.
Intermediate performance was observed under Cfa climate zones. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These results help to improve our understanding of the
uncertain sources of reanalysis data under different climate conditions, the
rational application of these datasets and the potential improvements for the
next product generation. In addition, they open promising perspectives for the
use of reanalysis data as an alternative data source to estimate ET0 for
irrigation water management in different climate contexts, overcoming the
limited availability of observed agrometeorological data in many areas. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abstract</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite
was launched in 1997, and the observations continued for more than 17 years.
The features of TRMM observation were as follows: (a) it followed a non-sun
synchronized orbit that enabled the diurnal variation of precipitation to be
investigated; (b) it carried a precipitation radar and microwave and infrared
radiometers, along with two instruments of opportunity in the form of a
lighting sensor and a radiation budget sensor; and (c) it worked as a standard
reference for precipitation measurements for other spaceborne microwave
radiometers, which enabled global rain maps to be developed. For science, TRMM
provided precise and accurate rain distributions over tropical and subtropical
regions. The rainfall results are primarily essential for the study of
precipitation climatologies, whereas the three-dimensional images of
precipitation systems enabled the study of the global characteristics of
precipitation systems. Technologically, the spaceborne rain radar onboard TRMM
demonstrated the effectiveness of radars in space, whereas the combination with
other rain observation instruments showed its effectiveness as a calibration
source. Multi-satellite rain maps in which TRMM was the reference standard have
been developed, and they became prototypes of the multi-satellite Earth
observation systems. On the basis of the great success of TRMM, the Global
Precipitation Measurement (GPM) was designed to expand TRMM’s coverage to
higher latitudes. The core satellite of GPM is equipped with a dual-frequency
precipitation radar (DPR) and a microwave radiometer. DPR comprises a Kuband
radar (KuPR) and a Ka-band radar (KaPR) and can discriminate solid from liquid
precipitation. The period of the precipitation measurement with spaceborne
radars extended to more than 23 years, which may make it possible to detect the
change of precipitation climatology related to change in the global
environment. Although TRMM’s and GPM’s accomplishments are very broad, this
paper attempts to highlight Japan’s contributions to the science of these
missions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forests, and high mountain regions lack extensive networks
(Kidd et al. 2017). Precipitation measurements from space are thus a viable
alternative for precipitation measurement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first spaceborne microwave radiometer for Earth
observation was launched by the Soviet Union in 1968 onboard COSMOS-243. In the
1970s, the United States pioneered precipitation measurement from space using
microwave radiometers, such as the Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer
onboard NUMBUS-5 and the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer onboard
NUMBUS-7 (e.g., Wilheit et al. 1976, 1977; Wilheit and Chang 1980). However,
the accuracy obtained was insufficient, and the microwave radiometer had
difficulty in mapping rain distribution over lands. The use of spaceborne rain
radar was then considered to be a strong and promising alternative. A workshop
entitled “Precipitation Measurements from Space” organized by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was held in the United States in 1981 to
encourage NASA’s headquarters to initiate a new precipitation measurement
program. In this workshop, visible/infrared (VIS/IR) and microwave passive
techniques were discussed, and the necessity of applying a spaceborne radar was
recognized. The workshop summary concisely and accurately described the status
of precipitation measurements in that era as follows (Atlas and Thiele 1981): </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The measurement of precipitation from space on a global
scale is a formidable problem because as yet there are no guaranteed methods
which can be relied upon to perform under all circumstances around the world.
Nevertheless, we already have some VIS and IR techniques that provide
climatologically useful data in the subtropical belt. Also, over the oceans we
are quite confident that these methods can be extended to extratropical regions
by means of improved microwave radiometers. The use of combinations of measurement
systems should be most valuable in filling the great gaps in our knowledge of
oceanic precipitation, and it would serve a broad spectrum of users both in
climate research and global weather prediction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Furthermore, for the first time, we now have a set of
conceptual methods including spaceborne radar, either by itself or as part of a
hybrid system, which show promise of operating over both land and ocean. At the
very least, these approaches deserve serious feasibility studies and field
trials. In short, the needs have been well articulated and the technology is
within reach. Therefore, it is time to proceed with a strong and well-ordered
program of study and development as summarized here and as detailed in the
report.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sixteen years after the workshop, the concept discussed
therein was realized at least partly by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission
(TRMM) in 1997. As soon as the TRMM project was authorized, discussions
regarding the successor of TRMM began. The primary objective of its successor
was to expand coverage from low-latitudes to include mid- and high- latitudes,
and it was suggested that the essential instruments should be a dual-frequency
precipitation radar (DPR) and a microwave radiometer with additional
high-frequency channels. Discussion for a TRMM successor then evolved into a
constellation system that has a core satellite that provides a standard
reference for precipitation measurements and several other satellites that
provide a high sampling frequency (Hou et al. 2014). This concept was
eventually realized as the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) in 2014. As
initially suggested, the GPM core observatory carries a DPR and a GPM microwave
radiometer (GMI).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This review paper briefly presents a history of TRMM as
described by Okamoto (2003) and some new findings related to global
precipitation measurements. It also describes how techniques used to conduct
precipitation measurements from space were developed, presents the GPM concept,
and discusses the current situations. This review focuses mainly on radars as
these are new global precipitation observation instruments. As the subject area
is broad and many important results exist (Houze et al. 2015), the paper is
limited largely to Japan’s activities related to TRMM and GPM, and the
references acknowledged are far from comprehensive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.1       Objectives of TRMM and precipitation radar</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TRMM was originally designed as a “flying rain gauge”
(Simpson et al. 1988). It was first conceptualized by NASA in the mid-1980s.
Japan collaborated with the program from the onset, and it eventually became a
full collaboration between the United States and Japan. The planned instruments
were a VIS/IR radiometer, a microwave radiometer, and a rain radar. At that
time spaceborne rain radars had not been realized, although active microwave
instruments, such as the synthetic aperture radar, as well as an altimeter, and
scatterometer had been flown in space aboard SEASAT, which was operated in 1978
(https:// directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/ s/seasat).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The final agreement called for the United States to provide
the satellite bus, the VIS/IR radiometer (VIRS), and the microwave radiometer
(TMI), whereas Japan provided the precipitation radar (PR) and the launch
service (Kummerow et al. 1998). The United States later added two Earth
Observing System instruments: the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS), and the
Clouds and Earth Radiant Energy System (CERES). Both countries were responsible
for all planning, data processing, and scientific activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The primary scientific objective of TRMM was to obtain a
precise distribution of rain over tropical and subtropical regions. At that
time, vigorous convections over the tropical western Pacific had already been
recognized as the driving engine of the atmospheric general circulation. The
Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere/Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment
(TOGA/COARE) was designed to investigate the interaction between this
convection and the tropical ocean (Webster and Lukas 1992). TRMM was originally
expected to be ready in time for use in </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TOGA/COARE, which was conducted from November 1992 to
February 1993. Unfortunately, the TRMM program was delayed. However, the
scientific objective remained, and TRMM was finally launched from the
Tanegashima Space Center, Japan, in November 1997.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TRMM was inserted into a 350 km orbit, which was
extraordinarily low compared with the heights of other low-orbit Earth
observation satellites (Table 1). This was necessary because the PR was an
active sensor, and its sensitivity was significantly degraded over longer
ranges. A second fundamental issue faced by the PR was its narrow swath.
Although a wider swath was preferred, technological issues, such as range
smearing, broadening of the surface echo at off-nadir angles, and limited dwell
time of the radar beam on each pixel prevented wide scan angles. The swath was
thus limited to approximately 200 km, and although this was narrow, it enabled
individual precipitation systems to be covered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The designed sensitivity of TRMM PR was approximately 18
dBZ, which corresponds to a rain rate of approximately 0.5 mm h&#8722;1.
Although this sensitivity is worse than ground-based precipitation radars, its
real power turned out to be the global observations of precipitation systems
regardless of over land or ocean. The disadvantages of a rather narrow swath
and limited sensitivity to very light precipitation were later mitigated by
combining the radar with microwave radiometers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Low-orbiting Earth-observing satellites usually follow
sun-synchronous orbits because (a) the consistent local time observation makes
it easy to detect long-term changes in the targets, (b) the small incidence
angle change of solar radiation makes the measured data easy to interpret, and
(c) the limited sun angle from the satellite reduces the complexity of its
thermal design of the satellite. Although the sun- synchronous orbit has
advantages, TRMM followed a non-sun synchronous orbit. This was mainly because
the fixed local time observation causes a bias in the precipitation
climatology, particularly in tropical regions where diurnal variations are
strong. TRMM’s low inclination orbit of 35° enabled all local time observations
to be obtained over one location in approximately 45 days, which meant it could
cover the entire diurnal cycle in less than one season. Although an even
smaller inclination is better for sampling tropical regions, rain associated
with the Asian monsoon, which is an essential component of the tropical
hydrologic cycle, extends to approximately 35° north.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The PR was developed by the National Space Development
Agency of Japan and the Communications Research Laboratory, Japan, and it was a
technologically advanced instrument. Table 2 shows the major specifications of
the PR. It was a pulse radar with an electrical scanning capability that used a
slotted waveguide system to observe precipitation from a satellite moving at
approximately 7 km s&#8722;1 (Nakamura et al. 1990; Kozu et al. 2001). The PR
had a mass of 465 kg, and it was the heaviest instrument onboard the TRMM
satellite. It used a frequency of 13.8 GHz, which was somewhat higher than
conventional ground-based rain radars that use 3&#8202;–&#8202;10 GHz (S- to
X-band). This frequency selection was a result of many trade-offs. For example,
the frequency of 13.8 GHz suffers from rain attenuation in heavy rain, but
although a lower frequency would have fewer attenuation problems, it results in
a wider radar beamwidth that degrades the spatial resolution. To provide
sufficient spatial resolution, a larger radar antenna was required, which then
caused the potential of launch vehicle issues. For a downward-looking radar,
the radiowave path in rain is typically as short as 5 km, which is much shorter
than that of a near horizontally scanning ground-based radar, and this mitigates
the rain attenuation problem. Another reason for the choice in frequency was
related to the international frequency allocations determined by the
International Telecommunication Union, which arranges frequency allocations to
avoid interferences between radiowave services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To deal with attenuation, a new rain retrieval algorithm,
the so-called surface reference technique (SRT) was proposed (Meneghini et al.
1983). This technique uses the surface echo to estimate the total attenuation.
Conventional rain retrievals use an empirical relationship between the rain
rate (R) and radar reflectivity (Z ) called the Z&#8202;–&#8202;R relationship
(e.g., Battan 1973). The rain-attenuated signal of the PR, however, needed
correction before this relationship could be applied. The conventional method used
to correct rain attenuation is that of the Hitschfeld–Bordan technique
(Hitschfeld and Bordan 1954). Given a unique relationship between the
equivalent radar reflectivity (Ze) and the specific rain attenuation (k), the
rain attenuation can be estimated from the measured radar reflectivity (Zm),
and the measured radar reflectivity can be corrected to give Ze . When the rain
attenuation is weak, this correction by the Hitschfeld–Bordan technique works
well, but when rain attenuation is strong, the correction becomes unstable.
This is because small errors or fluctuations in the measured radar reflectivity
or deviation from the assumed k&#8202;–&#8202;Ze relationship cause large
errors in the attenuation estimate. To overcome the instability, Meneghini (1978)
proposed an iterative method to solve the basic equation that relates measured
radar reflectivity to the attenuation corrected one. The method allowed only a
few iterations, but the problem remained. Because the spaceborne radar looks at
the Earth from above, the radar image includes strong surface echoes that
suffer from rain attenuation with the amount of attenuation depending on the
radiowave path length and the rain intensity. Hence, the reduction of the
surface echo from no-rain surface echo constrains the estimated rain intensity.
The SRT uses the total attenuation to suppress the instability in the
Hitschfeld–Bordan technique, and this was proven to work well (e.g., Meneghini
et al. 2000). The SRT was then successfully incorporated into the TRMM PR rain
retrieval algorithms (Iguchi et al. 2000, 2009). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The SRT was used not only for correcting rain attenuation
but also for estimating the raindrop size distribution (DSD). Rain retrieval
algorithms using radar </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fig. 1.  Global distribution of DSD-related parameters in
JJA over 10 years derived from TRMM PR data (Kozu </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>et al. 2009a). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>involves the relationship between radar reflectivity and the
rain rate, and this relationship depends on the DSD. Several studies focused on
the DSD beginning with the well-known paper of Marshall and Palmer (1948). A
known property of the DSD is its dependence on the rain type; stratiform rain
contains larger raindrops than convective rain (e.g., Tokay and Short 1996).
This concept differs slightly from the intuitive belief that convective rain
contains bigger raindrops. This is because convective rain usually has a high
rain rate, but the comparison between the DSDs of stratiform and convective
rain is made under the same rain rate. Using an estimate of the total
attenuation or path integrated attenuation (PIA) of a measured radar
reflectivity profile, a correction parameter known as epsilon was derived by
the PR and the DPR algorithm development teams. Epsilon is at least partly
related to the DSD, and it enables the estimation of DSD variation (Kozu et al.
2009a). Figure 1 shows the global distribution of a proportional coefficient in
the power law Z&#8202;–&#8202;R relationship derived from the correction
parameter and the rain rate. This figure represents the first global
distribution of a parameter relating to DSD variation. However, notably, the
correction parameter does not exactly show the DSD variation because epsilon is
affected by several other factors, such as the beam filling effect (Kirstetter
et al. 2015), multiple- scattering, attenuation in snow or melting layers, and
attenuation due to non-precipitation particles or gases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The downward-looking PR also detects an interesting
phenomenon, i.e., mirror images of precipitation over the ocean. The ocean
surface is a good reflector of microwave radiowaves, and the precipitation echo
has a mirrored echo that correlates with the direct precipitation echoes.
Differences between direct and mirrored echoes are mainly due to sea surface
reflectivity and rain attenuation (Meneghini and Atlas 1986; Li and Nakamura
2002). Although such differences have the potential to be used in PR rain retrievals,
this has not yet been realized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The TRMM produced remarkable precipitation images following
its successful launch. The first impressive image from the PR was a
three-dimensional (3D) image of Cyclone Pam over the Pacific Ocean on 8
December 1997, only 10 days after it had been launched (Hiroshima et al. 1998)
(Fig. 2). The image symbolically shows the unique capability of the TRMM PR to
observe the 3D structure of a precipitation system over the vast ocean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The combination of the PR, TMI, and LIS demonstrated the
full capability for observing precipitation systems. The TMI’s advantages over
the PR are its wide swath, which is approximately three times wider than the
PR’s. The lack of vertical information from the TMI was overcome using PR’s
vertical structure of precipitation. This combinational use of data is
described in the next section. This has led to better products as well as
better sampling not only from TRMM but also from several additional microwave radiometers
onboard other satellites, such as the SSM/I onboard DMSP satellites, and their
combined observations have enabled global rain mapping using multi- satellite
data. LIS detects lightning which is a good indicator of solid particle
existence. LIS and PR data showed that deep convective systems can produce
lightning (e.g., Petersen and Rutledge 2001). A global map of lightning yield
per rain amount was generated (Takayabu 2006), and the lightning yield was
found to be much higher over land compared with over ocean, which indicates
that mixed-phase convection is more frequent over land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, the features of TRMM is that (a) it followed a
non-sun synchronous orbit that enabled diurnal variation of precipitation to be
investigated; (b) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>it had a PR and microwave and infrared radiometers, which
enabled the three-dimensional structure of precipitation systems to be
investigated; and (c) it worked as a standard reference for precipitation
measurements for other spaceborne microwave radiometers, which enabled global
rain maps to be developed utilizing satellite data as the primary inputs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.2       Long-term observations</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It cannot be emphasized enough that the benefits of TRMM
were greatly expanded by long-term observations (Houze et al. 2015). The
original operation time of TRMM was expected to be only 3 years. The radar
systems were only minimally redundant because of the research nature of the
TRMM. Nevertheless, TRMM sensors worked without any serious problems for
several years except for CERES, which malfunctioned in the early TRMM
operational stages. Ultimately, TRMM’s life span was limited by the fuel needed
to maintain its orbit. The long-term data accumulated resulted not only in the
ability to make a precise estimation of climatological rain distribution, which
was the primary objective, but also in the ability to identify and analyze the
evolution of the precipitation systems through the use of composite data from
the same season, events, or local time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Long-term observations also provided the ability to observe
interannual variability and extreme events; for example, the differences
between the precipitation characteristics of El Niño and La Niña. El Niño
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a well-known teleconnection phenomenon driven by
the tropical ocean– atmosphere interaction (Bjerknes 1966, 1969). There,
satellite cloud maps were used to show that ENSO is a global-scale phenomenon.
Precipitation data from TRMM were used to show more clearly that ENSO is a
global-scale phenomenon. Figure 3 shows the anomalies of precipitation and sea
surface temperature (SST) distribution between El Niño and a normal year, which
clearly indicates the strong connection between precipitation activity and SST
(Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency 2008). During El Niño, the precipitation
maximum moves to the central Pacific, where precipitation has similar
characteristics to the deep convection over the western Pacific that occur in
normal years (e.g., Berg et al. 2002). TRMM also identified lightning activity
in relation to ENSO over Indonesia, and it was determined that activity was
stronger (weaker) during El Niño (La Niña) events (Hamid et al. 2001). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The long-term TRMM observations enabled the morphology of
global precipitation systems to be identified not only the distribution of rain
but also the structure and evolution of precipitation systems as described
later. The TRMM data have also been used widely in investigations of the
dynamical structure of the precipitation systems using reanalysis data from
ECMWF, NOAA, and JMA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.3       Global precipitation maps</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The primary objective of TRMM was to obtain rain
accumulations over tropical and subtropical regions. Three major types of
global rain maps from TRMM have been generated, namely, one from the PR only,
one from the microwave radiometer (TMI) only, and one compiled using
combinations of PR, TMI, and geostationary satellite data. These have enabled
uncertainties in global total rain or zonally averaged rain totals to be
considerably reduced (e.g., Kummerow et al. 2000; Adler et al. 2009).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 4 shows an example of annual global precipitation
derived from TRMM PR data for 1999&#8202;–&#8202;2013 with a 0.1° resolution in
a Google map style (https:// www.rain-clim.com/rainmap.html). The wet regions,
such as the intertropical convergence zone, are well depicted. This figure can
be compared with that of Dorman and Bourke (1979) (Fig. 5), which was generated
from ship data over a period spanning more than 20 years. The progress made
using TRMM data is obvious, particularly with respect to spatial resolution.
One of the main results of TRMM observations is the ability to identify
contrasts between the land and ocean. Although Fig. 4 does not show the
coastline, it is easily identifiable. Before the advent of TRMM, it was
well-known that the maritime continent experiences a significant amount of
rainfall; however, the distribution had not been documented. TRMM showed the
distribution clearly, and it is evident that large islands receive considerable
amounts of rainfall compared with the straits between large islands. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The accuracy of rain maps using microwave radiometer data
was greatly improved by using the PR’s 3D structure of precipitation systems.
Microwave rain retrievals over the ocean are in the so-called emission mode,
where strong microwave emissions from rain are clearly detected over weak ocean
surface emissions. However, land emissions are comparable with those from rain.
Thus, retrievals of rain over land are made using a scattering mode that uses
ice scattering in the upper part of the precipitation system. The amount of ice
or the depth of the solid particle layer acts as an index that characterizes
the precipi-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>tation system. However, this retrieval method has an
inferior accuracy compared with the emission mode. Microwave radiometers
usually have multi-frequency and polarization channels, and rain retrievals use
multichannel data. A well-known retrieval algorithm is Goddard Profiling
Algorithm (e.g., Kummerow et al. 2001), which uses typical profiles derived
from the PR profiles and computed microwave radiances. The measured data from
microwave channels are then used to estimate rain rate via a Bayesian method. The
vertical profiles of precipitation systems from PR are essential for this
method. The difference between the microwave radiometer derived rain rate and
PR estimates was investigated using vertical profiles of precipitation measured
by the PR in the early phase of TRMM observations (e.g., Fu and Liu 2001; Berg
et al. 2002; Battaglia et al. 2003; Masunaga et al. 2002; Shige et al. 2006,
2008a). For example, the discrepancy between PR and TMI rain estimates depends
on the depth of the rain layer derived from the height of the bright band
observed by the PR (Ikai and Nakamura 2003; Furuzawa and Nakamura 2005). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Compared with the PR, microwave radiometer rain retrieval
algorithms developed in the United States occasionally produce a much lower
rain rate over East Asia in summer. Summer rain in East Asia is associated with
the Asian monsoon and is called Baiu in Japan, Meiyu in China, or Changma in
Korea; the frontal system that produces the summer rain is known as a water
vapor front rather than a temperature front (e.g., Ninomiya 1984). The
convective instability is not very strong, and both satellite data and ground
observations have enabled precipitation to be characterized as driven by warm
rain processes. This observation has led to a concept of “wet Asia”, where the
troposphere is humid and the storm top is rather low (Sohn et al. 2010, 2013;
Song and Sohn 2015). This fact was strengthened by the results of the
precipitation structure during the summer monsoon in Asia (Shige and Kummerow
2016; Shige et al. 2017).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are several other microwave radiometers currently in
orbit, and global rain maps, such as TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis
(TMPA) (Huffman et al. 2007, 2010), GSMaP (e.g., Kubota et al. 2007), and
CMORPH (Joyce et al. 2004, 2010), are generated by combining data from several
microwave radiometers. These maps became successful prototypes for the
Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) virtual constellation concept
(https:// ceos.org/ourwork/virtual-constellations/). The virtual constellations
are a voluntary-based multi-satellite global observation system organized in
CEOS, and their themes encompass precipitation, land surface imaging, SST,
atmospheric composition, ocean color radiometry, and ocean surface topography.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rain maps initiated using TRMM data are being continuously
developed. Large differences are frequently observed between the daily
precipitation amount estimated from satellite data and that measured from
ground-based instruments. Such discrepancies are due to (a) uncertainty in the
rain retrieval algorithm and (b) poor sampling. Precipitation, particularly
torrential rain, has considerable temporal and spatial variability. To overcome
the error source of poor sampling, the idea of the constellation system was
proposed in the United States in the 1990s. However, even when multi-radiometer
data are used, the sampling interval is typically three hours, and short-time
torrential rain can be missed. Interpolation techniques are thus applied in
global rain mapping, and one example is the motion vector technique. In this
respect, geostationary meteorological satellites observe clouds at a high
frequency, and the motion vectors of clouds can be derived. The precipitation
distribution sampled over a few hours can thus be interpolated using the motion
vectors to distribute the precipitation (Joyce et al. 2004; Ushio et al. 2009).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) developed the
Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) which comprises several rain
map versions for various applications. In terms of data latency, near-real-time
data are required for the shortterm predictions of weather and flash flood
warnings. However, climate studies use more accurate data comprised of full
auxiliary data, but this requires a longer data latency. The GSMaP currently
has several products: a near-real-time version with four hours latency called
GSMaP_NRT, one with a latency of three days (GSMaP_MVK), a gauge-adjusted
nearreal-time version (GSMaP_Gauge_NRT), a non-realtime gauge-adjusted version
(GSMaP_Gauge), and a real-time version (GSMaP_NOW) (Kubota et al. 2020). NASA
currently provides a map called Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM
(IMERG), which was developed from the TMPA (Huffman et al. 2020). IMERG has a
spatial resolution of 0.1° and several temporal resolution versions from 0.5 h
to 1 month (https://gpm.nasa.gov/data-access/downloads/ gpm).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The requirements for accuracy of global maps have reached a
phase where local precipitation characteristics are incorporated in the rain
estimate algorithms (e.g., Aonashi et al. 2009). For example, orographic rain
usually has low cloud tops resulting in underestimated rain rate in microwave
radiometer retrievals (Kubota et al. 2009). A dynamic selection of lookup
tables based on orographic/nonorographic rainfall classification is
incorporated in specified mountainous regions (Shige et al. 2013, 2014; Taniguchi
et al. 2013; Yamamoto and Shige 2015; Yamamoto et al. 2017).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Three types of algorithms can be applied to compile rain
maps: rain gauge adjustment methods, data assimilation methods, and the use of
satellite-based retrieval algorithms. The rain gauge adjustment method (e.g.,
Mega et al. 2019) is similar to the technique widely used to adjust
ground-based rain radar patterns with rain gauge data, such as the radar-AMeDAS
composite map provided by JMA (Makihara 1996). This technique is very
practical, but the underlying reason for the adjustment is sometimes difficult
to comprehend, particularly, in gauge sparse regions. A data assimilation
method with atmospheric models is another way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Current atmospheric models are very sophisticated, and most
data can be ingested if their accuracy and the error covariance matrices are
known. Four-dimensional variational data assimilation or the ensemble the
Kalman filter method (Kotsuki et al. 2017, 2019; Boukabara et al. 2020; Miyoshi
et al. 2020) is a common method used today. Rain maps can be generated as one
of the outputs of the models. Here, the rain distribution is dynamically
consistent with other atmospheric parameters, such as temperature and winds.
Rain maps can also be produced using satellite data only. In this case, the
accuracy of the product depends solely on the capability of the satellite
sensors and the rain retrieval algorithms applied. This type of rain map is
independent of the forecast model’s assumptions and provides excellent data for
use in model evaluations. Note that unlike the gauge-adjusted map, the
discrepancy between satellite estimates and truth reflects local precipitation
characteristics, and such information can be used when conducting studies on
local precipitation system characteristics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The spatiotemporal resolution of global rain maps has been
continuously improved, and hourly 0.1° resolutions can now be attained. If a
climatological map is required instead of an instantaneous map, a satellite
rain map can be generated at very high spatial resolution from PR data. As the
PR has a pencil beam with a horizontal resolution of approximately 4 km at
nadir, a very fine rain map can be generated using the longterm accumulation of
rain data within finely spaced grid boxes (Hirose and Okada 2018).
Precipitation is strongly affected by surface topography, which can exhibit
large variations. Thus, climatological precipitation contains fine-scale
patterns over land relative to the ocean (Hirose et al. 2017; Shige et al.
2017). For example, there are fine-scale variations in spatial precipitation
over Southeast Asia where large mountain ranges exist, and rain is distributed
on the windward side of the mountain slopes (Fig. 6). Remote islands in the
ocean may also experience enhanced rain. For example, Yakushima Island covers
an area of approximately 400 km2 and has a mountain with a height of
approximately 2000 m; it experiences 4000 mm of rain annually, and the
satellite map clearly shows concentrated precipitation on the southeast side of
the island (Fig. 7).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Precipitation measurements from space have an essential role
in gaining an understanding of both the global water cycle and the energy
cycle. The global energy cycle has attracted considerable scientific attention
concerning global warming, and the energy transfer between the atmosphere and
Earth’s surface </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>has been studied in depth. Nevertheless, there are inherent
difficulties in measuring each of the components. The energy input and output
to and from the top of the atmosphere are measured by satellites with
sufficient accuracy. However, measuring the energy partition in the atmosphere
is uncertain. Latent heating is one of the major components of the energy
cycle, and energy budget investigations suggested that the observed energy
transferred by the release of latent heat is slightly more than that obtained
from model estimates (Stephens et al. 2012). As latent heating is closely
related to precipitation, it is essential to obtain accurate precipitation
measurements to gain a better understanding of the energy cycle. Despite all
the advances in radar, radiometer, and composite products, there remains a
disagreement of perhaps 10 % among products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.4       Precipitation system climatology</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Accumulated rainfall distributions are the most important
data used to elucidate the global water cycle, and the second most important
data are the precipitation system characteristics. For example, even with the
same rain total, the type of rain can differ and can, for instance, comprise
short heavy rain or light persistent rain. In terms of atmospheric circulation,
tall precipitation systems have different effects in the atmosphere than those
of widespread light precipita-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>tion systems. Regarding societal impacts, torrential rain
causes high river discharges, flash floods, and sometimes landslides, whereas
persistent light rain is probably more beneficial. The 3D structure of the
precipitation system obtained from the PR opened the era of global
precipitation system climatology studies. In this respect, “precipitation
system climatology” refers to the precipitation climatology including the storm
structures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Storm top height is one of the indices used to characterize
precipitation systems (e.g., Takayabu 2002). The storm height obtained from the
TRMM PR is defined as the top of contiguous rain echo bins. For example,
Masunaga et al. (2005) used the PR echotop height and the VIRS brightness
temperature to categorize storms. The storm top height also shows large-scale
characteristics of the precipitation systems. Figure 8 shows the storm top
distribution at a latitude of 35° north in summer 1998 (Japan Aerospace Exploration
Agency 2008). Very high precipitation systems occur frequently from the Tibetan
Plateau to the East China Sea, whereas shallow systems dominate over the
eastern Pacific Ocean with cloud tops becoming lower toward the east. Before
TRMM observations, the distribution of shallow precipitation over the eastern
Pacific was observed by limited ship observations. The TRMM PR showed the
distribution of shallow convection for the first time as shown in Fig. 9 (Short
and Nakamura 2000). The relationship between deep/ shallow convections and the
environmental conditions was investigated, and it was found that large-scale
subsidence and SST both control the storm structure over tropical oceans (e.g.,
Takayabu 2010).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Fig. 10.            Dominant precipitations
derived from TRMM PR data (Takayabu 2008).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TRMM data, particularly, PR data can be used to identify
areas with deep convection (Zipser et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2007). For example,
those within the Congo basin in Africa, the eastern side of the Rocky mountain
range in North America, and the deepest precipitations region in Argentina are
clearly discernable. Although severe rain is generally associated with deep
convection, a detailed study showed that deepest convection does not always
correspond to the most intense rain for regional extreme rainfall events
(Hamada et al. 2015). The relationship between rain rate and the precipitation
system structure varies widely, and PR’s data on the 3D structure of
precipitation system, such as shallow/deep convections and orographic rain,
helped better understanding the relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Squall lines in the tropical regions have distinct features;
narrow and deep convective lines are followed by widespread persistent
(stratiform) rain (Houze 1977). The dynamical structures of convective and
stratiform systems differ: convective regions have strong updrafts, whereas
stratiform regions have weak updrafts. Deep convective (stratiform)
precipitation indicates a highly (weakly) unstable atmosphere. The DSD
characteristics are also different, and these are incorporated into the rain
retrieval algorithms (Iguchi et al. 2000; Kozu et al. 2009b). In PR and DPR
rain retrieval algorithms, the vertical profile, horizontal extent, and rain
rate are used for the precipitation type classification (Awaka et al. 2009,
2016). In the vertical profile of radar echoes, the melting layer frequently
appears as a strong echo layer, which is known as a bright band in radar
meteorology. The existence of the bright band in measured radar reflectivity is
primarily used to identify stratiform rain. The distribution of convective/stratiform
rain, the total rain area, the ratio of convective/stratiform types, and rain
top heights are used to identify the precipitation regimes in each season as
severe thunderstorms, afternoon showers, shallow systems, extratropical frontal
systems, organized systems, and others, as shown in Fig. 10 (Taka yabu 2008).
The regime characterization of precipitation systems over the tropical ocean
has also been obtained using a clustering technique and parameters such as the
convective surface rain rate and the ratio of convective rain to total rain
(Elsaesser et al. 2010).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was known that the precipitation systems have different
characteristics depending on over land and over ocean. TRMM data updated this
view as the characteristics depend on over land, ocean, and coastlines and
suggested a role of the precipitation over coastlines as the dehydrator between
the ocean and land (Ogino et al. 2016, 2017).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The monsoon is a tropical phenomenon characterized by
significant variations in precipitation and typically appears in the South Asia
and Amazon regions. Precipitation characteristics have been widely studied in
the Indian subcontinent region using TRMM data and reanalysis data, and a few
results are presented here. In the monsoon season, the Meghalaya region is
known for large amounts of total rainfall. TRMM with reanalysis data showed
that the peaks of Meghalaya mountain do not extend beyond roughly 2000 m;
however, a large amount of humid air is available from the Bay of Bengal, and
even a low mountain range triggers large amounts of rain (Fujinami et al.
2017).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was known from early satellite observations that offshore
regions of the Western Ghats in India experience a large amount of rain in the
monsoon season (Krishnamurti et al. 1983; Grossman and Garcia 1990). TRMM
observations revealed a more detailed distribution of rain around the Western
Ghats (Huffman et al. 2001; Adler et al. 2003; Shige et al. 2017). PR
identified rainfall maxima on the upslope of the Western Ghats, which neither
the GPCP (Adler et al. 2003; Huffman et al. 2001) nor the TMPA (Huffman et al.
2007) did (Shige et al. 2017).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Himalayan mountain range, the Tibetan Plateau, and the
northern region of the Deccan Plateau experience large rainfall totals in the
monsoon season from June to August with rain that is weak but persistent. By
contrast, the total amount of rain in the pre-monsoon season, such as during
May, is not particularly high but can have much more intense rain events (e.g.,
Bhatt and Nakamura 2005, 2006). East–west variations are also evident;
precipitation on the west side is more convective than on the east side.
Reanalysis data show that the lower atmosphere is very humid over the western
region due to wind from the Bay of Bengal, and the upper atmosphere is warm and
rather dry in relation to the north wind from the Tibetan Plateau. The
atmosphere thus has high convective inhibition (CIN), and rain likely becomes
intense once precipitation starts. By contrast, all the troposphere is humid
and CIN is low on the east side., which results in persistent but rather weak
rain (Houze et al. 2007; Romatschke et al. 2010; Medina et al. 2010). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The seasonal variation in precipitation systems associated
with the monsoon has led to the concept of a “green ocean”. Precipitation is
generally more convective over land than over ocean because of strong surface
heating and frequent dry air occurring in the middle atmosphere, which leads to
strong atmospheric instability. Although, heavy precipitation over land
generally occurs during the wet seasons, detailed studies conducted over the
Deccan Plateau and Amazon have shown variations in and around the wet season.
At the beginning of the wet season, precipitation is associated with strong and
high convective systems. By contrast, during the mature wet season,
precipitation becomes more stratiform and is associated with slightly lower
storm height systems (Petersen and Rutledge 2001; Petersen 2002; Williams et
al. 2002). Similar characteristics occur in Bangladesh (e.g., Islam and Uyeda
2008). Lightning activity is strong (weak) in pre- (mature) monsoon season,
which also suggests rather strong (weak) convections in pre- (mature) monsoon
season (Kodama et al. 2005). In other words, the precipitation characteristics
over the wet Amazon or Deccan Plateau resemble those over the oceans. The
vertical profiles of precipitation over the Deccan Plateau in pre-monsoon and
mature monsoon seasons have also been investigated (Hirose and Nakamura 2002,
2004). The precipitation systems are higher for pre-monsoon seasons, and there
is a slight reduction in rain content for lower parts of the profiles, which
suggests that raindrops evaporate. However, the profile is vertical during the
mature monsoon season, which suggests that the entire layer is sufficiently
humid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As previously mentioned, TRMM is in a non-sun synchronous
orbit. Since precipitation is strongly affected by solar radiation, it has a
distinct diurnal cycle. Over land, this variation is strong, but it is
relatively weak over the vast ocean, as there is less thermal forcing from the
surface. For example, the land surface temperature easily changes in a range of
more than 10°C, but the temperature of the ocean surface changes usually in
less than 1°C. The diurnal variation over the ocean occurs in relation to other
factors, such as nighttime cloud top radiation cooling or the influence from
land such as the land and sea breeze. Long-term observations of the TRMM showed
that the non-sun synchronous orbit not only avoids the diurnal variation bias
in rain totals, but it also helps to investigate the precipitation
characteristics concerning diurnal variations (e.g., Nesbitt and Zipser 2003).
Figure 11 shows a map of local time when the rain is at its maximum (Hirose et
al. 2008), and it is evident that precipitation over land has an evening or
night peak but that over oceans has a morning peak, particularly near the
coasts. Figure 12 shows the distribution of isolated precipitation systems at
09:00 and 15:00 local time derived from TRMM PR data, where the different
occurrence of the systems at a different time of day was evident.
Interestingly, the peak local time was found to propagate inland in the eastern
part of Brazil or the maritime continent (Fig. 11), and this fact helped to
improve the cumulus parameterization of a global atmospheric model (Takayabu
and Kimoto 2008). The propagation of the peak local time is also clear over
Sumatra and Borneo Islands and the associated dynamical characteristics have
been investigated using reanalysis data (e.g., Mori et al. 2004; Ichikawa and
Yasunari 2006; Ogino et al. 2016). Such studies have shown that the propagation
is characterized by the land and sea breeze embedded in the prevailing monsoon
wind. Similar diurnal variations appear over the Tibetan Plateau, which contains
many lakes, and it has been found that early morning rain likely occurs over
large lakes, which suggests that large lakes act </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>like the ocean (Singh and Nakamura 2009). Over the Western
Ghats and Myanmar coast, large rainfall amounts with small amplitude of diurnal
variations are observed under strong environmental flow implying that rainfall
is associated with mechanically driven convection (Shige et al. 2017).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of precipitation is stronger during the pre-monsoon season
than the mature monsoon season, which indicates an existence of an unstable
atmosphere (Bhatt and Nakamura 2005). Similarly, the diurnal variation is
strong (weak) over the Deccan Plateau in the break (active) spells of the
monsoon (Singh and Nakamura 2010). Furthermore, the amplitude of the diurnal
cycle over the upslope of the Western Ghats is smallest in the intraseasonal
oscillation rainfall anomaly phase during the largest boreal summer, and it is
largest during the large-scale active phase (Shige et al. 2017). Another
example comes from mountainous regions; distinct morning rain occurs over the
southern slope of the Himalayas, and the near-surface wind shows significant
diurnal variation and becomes mountain (valley) wind in the early morning
(evening). According to the wind variation, precipitation also shows diurnal
variations with notable morning rain peaks associated with the convergence
between prevailing monsoon wind and the morning downwind over the slope (Fig.
13) (Bhatt and Nakamura 2006). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A typhoon is a typical large-scale atmospheric phenomenon
generated over regions of warm water, such as the tropical western Pacific.
Their accurate and timely forecasts are crucial for disaster prevention. TRMM
observations of typhoons over vast ocean areas increased the understanding of
the structure of typhoons (e.g., Cecil and Zipser 1999; Hoshino and Nakazawa
2007; Yokoyama and Takayabu 2008).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.5       Evolution of precipitation systems </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TRMM observation data represent accumulated snapshots. The
time evolution of precipitation systems is not directly observed, but long-term
observations can be used to collect the statistics of the evolution of
precipitation systems. One example is the diurnal variations in scales of the
precipitation system; Several small systems first appear and these systems
aggregate and evolve to large and vigorous systems (Hirose and Nakamura 2005).
Long-term TRMM observation data can also be combined with data from geostationary
meteorological satellites, which observe cloud distribution continuously using
the VIS/IR technique. Combining various local time observations with the
continuous geostationary satellite data can at least partly overcome the
difficulties involved in studying the evolution of precipitation systems.
Geostationary satellite data show the extent of clouds and their top heights,
and the PR and TMI observe the structure of the precipitation system. Using the
TMI, PR, and geostationary satellite data, the evolution of a precipitation
system over the tropical Pacific Ocean was investigated, and the results showed
that the systems were initially small and low before evolving into a deep
strong system with intense rain and finally became wide systems containing a
large amount of stratiform rain and expanded high clouds (Kondo et al. 2006;
Imaoka and Nakamura 2012). This evolution process is also reflected in the peak
local time differences of brightness temperatures observed with VIRS and TMI,
and of the surface rain rate observed with PR (Yamamoto et al. 2008). This type
of evolution has been observed in a limited number of field experiments, and
the long-term observation data of TRMM validate these characteristics
statistically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Composite analyses have been widely conducted using TRMM
precipitation data along with other satellite data, such as OLR or reanalysis
data. A popular method used to obtain the characteristics of the system of
interest is to analyze with composite maps, the center of which (e.g., an area
of intense precipitation) moves with the system. Equatorial regions have
distinct intraseasonal variation, such as the Madden– Julian Oscillation (MJO)
(Madden and Julian 1971, 1972), and the characteristics of the MJO have been
investigated with respect to the equatorial Rossby wave and Kelvin wave
(Masunaga et al. 2006). A relationship between El Niño and MJO was also shown
by Takayabu et al. (1999). Composite analyses using TRMM and A-train satellites
revealed interactions between large-scale disturbances and the precipitation
systems including convective mass flux (Masunaga </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2012, 2013; Masunaga and Luo 2016). A moisture budget has
also been analyzed to show the structure of equatorial inertia–gravity waves
(Sumi and Masunaga 2016). Another example is the relationship between
precipitation characteristics in the Baiu front and the subtropical jet using
TRMM PR and reanalysis data (Yokoyama et al. 2014, 2017). These examples
indicate that TRMM data have become a standard and essential dataset used to
study the relationship between large-scale atmospheric conditions and precipitation
characteristics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.6       Latent heating</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Latent heating is not only an essential component in the
global energy balance but also one of the major drivers of general circulation.
The column total latent heating is equivalent to the surface rain when a
sufficiently large area is considered, and the total column latent heating can
be determined when an accurate distribution of the rain is obtained. However,
the vertical profile of latent heating is necessary to understand the driving
mechanism behind the general circulation. In ground observations, the vertical
profile of latent heating is generally obtained from heat and moisture budgets
along with wind data. Wind data are generally not obtained from satellites,
except for wind vectors derived from cloud images of geostationary satellites
or the sea surface wind derived from scatterometers. However, as the wind
vectors derived from geostationary satellites had a coarse vertical resolution,
the global 3D structure of latent heat release was not available. TRMM
observations discriminate precipitation systems into convective and stratiform
systems. Field experiments, such as the GARP Atlantic Experiment in 1974
(Kuettner 1974) or TOGA/COARE have shown that heating profiles differ depending
on the convective/stratiform rain types (Mapes and Houze 1995; Houze 1997). It
has been determined that convective precipitation causes heating in all levels,
whereas stratiform precipitation causes heating in the upper levels and cooling
in the lower levels due to evaporation (Fig. 14). Heating profiles of convective
and stratiform precipitation systems were derived on the basis of the results
of field experiments in addition to fine-scale non-hydrostatic model results.
Global latent heating profiles were then obtained using TRMM’s
convective/stratiform rain classifications (see a review by Tao et al. 2006,
2016). A few major algorithms for latent heating are currently available. One
of them was developed at the Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA, and it
originally used TMI and PR data that provided information about convective/stratiform
classifications and the surface rain rate, and latent heating is obtained in
the wide swath of microwave radiometers (Takayabu and Tao 2020). Another
algorithm is developed in Japan, and it uses PR precipitation profiles (Shige
et al. 2004, 2007, 2008b, 2009). The rain types, rain rate at the surface, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>rain rate at the height of the melting layer, and storm top
height are used as the input parameters for model latent heating profiles, but
retrieval is limited to the PR swath. The algorithm produces a reasonable 3D
latent heating structure (e.g., Fig. 15). Both algorithms use lookup tables
generated from cloud-resolving models, and they provide not only the latent
heating (apparent heat source) but also the apparent moisture sink.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.7       Validation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Remote sensing is used to observe the Earth environment from
satellites. However, it is rare that the required physical quantity, such as
surface rain rate in the case of TRMM, can be measured directly by the
instruments onboard satellites, and retrieval algorithms are thus used. Several
assumptions are made in this respect, which cause discrepancies between
estimates and the truth. The validation of estimates and the development of
retrieval algorithms are being continually conducted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Several countries, such as Japan, the United States, and
Korea have dense rain gauge networks, and the most conventional method used to
make precipitation measurements reliable is to compare satellite surface rain
estimates with ground-based rain measurements. Both instantaneous and
accumulation comparisons were made. Instantaneous comparisons were made between
ground-based radar images and satellite images, and to mitigate the spatial and
temporal differences between the observations, spatiotemporal interpolation was
usually applied. The resulting similarity between the rain distributions
obtained was remarkable, and the results confirmed the validity of mapping rain
distribution from spaceborne instruments. Regarding the PR, comparisons between
PR reflectivity and that from the ground-based radar were conducted, which was
a more direct comparison than using rain rates. The correlation between radar
reflectivities was usually good, but biases have been found between the
results. Discrepancies have mainly been attributed to ground-based radar
calibration errors rather than those of the PR. The original idea behind making
comparisons was to validate satellite-measured radar reflectivity, but what was
quickly found is that ground-based radar can be calibrated by TRMM PR
(Anagnostou et al. 2001; Warren et al. 2018).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Regarding comparisons of accumulated rain, several
investigations have been conducted in various countries using rain gauge data.
Such investigations are essential for enabling the real application of
satellite rain maps in, for example, the water resources management and flood
forecasts in these countries. Satellite rain maps generally provide good data
when using seasonal accumulation, whereas rain totals over short-time scales,
such as daily rain totals do not always show good results. The precipitation maps
using primarily satellite data are internationally validated using ground
observations as the activity of the International Precipitation Working Group
established as a permanent Working Group of the Coordination Group for
Meteorological Satellites (Kidd et al. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2020b). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rain retrieval algorithms invariably use assumptions. To
validate these assumptions and evaluate the estimates, several specific field
experiments have been conducted. For example, an aircraft experiment was
conducted by NASA to validate SRT (Durden et al. 2003). In this experiment,
variation in ocean surface radar signatures was measured, and the result
provided uncertainty estimates for SRT. Besides specific experiments, NASA
conducted several comprehensive field experiments using both ground-based and
aircraft observations. The aircraft observations were conducted to provide in
situ data of cloud and precipitation particles as well as to simulate satellite
observations. One example was the TRMM–Large Scale Biosphere– Atmosphere
Experiment in Amazonia (TRMM-LBA), which was conducted over the Amazonian
regions from 1 November 1998 to 28 February 1999 (https://
cloud1.arc.nasa.gov/trmmlba/overview.html), in which the precipitation
characteristics associated with the South American monsoon were investigated (e.g.,
Petersen et al. 2002). NASA also conducted a field experiment around Kwajalein
Atoll (KWAJEX) in the tropical Pacific in 1999 (e.g., Houze et al. 2004), and
several results relating to convection over the tropical ocean were
accumulated. Several of these studies included the direct comparison of PR data
with ground-based radar data (e.g., Schumacher and Houze 2000). NASA has
continued to conduct large field experiments such as the Mid-latitude
Continental Convective Clouds Experiment in 2011, and the Olympic Mountain
Experiment (OLYMPEX) in 2015&#8202;–&#8202;2016. OLYMPEX was conducted to
observe snow in mountainous regions in relation to GPM. In Japan, a small field
experiment, the Ishigaki/Miyako Campaign Experiment for TRMM, which included
observations by ground-based and airborne radars, was conducted to validate
TRMM PR rain observations (Hanado et al. 1998).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to the results of statistical comparisons of
ground-based observations and estimated rain totals, discrepancies between
estimates and truth were examined. For example, missing rain due to the limited
sensitivity of PR causes underestimates (Shimizu et al. 2009). Another example
is the extrapolation of vertical profiles of precipitation echo to the surface.
The PR cannot always detect rain near the surface. This phenomenon particularly
occurs near the edge of the radar scan, where surface echo contamination
expands, and surface rain is estimated from the rain in contamination-free
layers. This extrapolated estimate is called “e_SurfRain” in the PR products.
However, when the rain profile deviates from being uniform, extrapolation will
have errors (Hirose et al. 2012).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.         GPM</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.1       Objectives of GPM</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After the remarkable success of TRMM, scientists aimed to
expand the coverage over the limited tropical and subtropical observations of
TRMM. To accomplish this, the GPM was designed. Solid precipitation frequently
falls in high latitude regions; thus, accurate water equivalent snow fall
estimates are necessary to provide the precipitation total in high latitude
regions. To obtain these, the use of a dual-frequency radar was proposed and
ultimately realized as the DPR. Notably, the original design of the TRMM PR was
a dual- wavelength radar, but it was descoped to a single frequency radar
because of budget limitation. The DPR applies 13.6 GHz and 35.5 GHz radiowaves,
which are very similar to the originally proposed PR frequencies of 13.8 GHz
and 35 GHz (Table 2). The radar type is also the same as the planar slotted
waveguide active array system with two-frequency agility. The development of
the DPR, however, was simpler than the original PR regarding some components
such as the phase shifter because of the development of microwave technology.
Following the successful launch, it was found that the sidelobe clutters in
13.6 GHz radar (KuPR) data were stronger than expected, but the clutter was
sufficiently suppressed after tuning the phase shifters (Kubota et al. 2016).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The core observatory of GPM is equipped with the DPR and a
GMI and its inclination angle is 65°, which is much higher than that of TRMM
(Table 1). The GMI is more advanced than the TMI, and it adopts additional new
high frequency (166 GHz and 183 GHz) channels, which are the water vapor
channels required to detect snowfall. The GMI has a much larger antenna of 1.2
m than the TMI, which results in a better spatial resolution (Hou et al. 2014;
Skofronick- Jackson et al. 2017).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.2       DPR performance</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The DPR was included in the GPM to observe the 3D structure
of precipitation systems over regions where TRMM PR did not cover. For example,
vertical structures were compared between tropics and extratropics (Kobayashi
et al. 2018), and downward increasing profiles of rain due to warm rain process
were identified. The characteristics of precipitation over Alaska were
investigated by Aoki and Shige (2021). Coastline and mountain effects appear
clearly in their analysis (Fig. 16).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The DPR also enabled the following: (a) observations of
weaker precipitation systems, (b) better liquid/ solid precipitation
discrimination, and (c) more accurate rain rate retrievals. The sensitivity of
the DPR’s Ku-radar (KuPR) is a few dB higher than the originally designed
value, thanks to the increase in transmitted power and improvements made to the
receivers. The sensitivity of the DPR’s Ka-radar (KaPR) was the same as its
design (Kojima et al. 2012; Masaki et al. 2020). The sensitivity was also investigated
using statistics of KuPR and KaPR reflectivities (e.g., Toyoshima et al. 2015;
Hamada and Takayabu 2016). Thus, the first objective (a) was attained by both
KuPR improvement and the inclusion of KaPR. The second objective (b) has been
attained as, for example, a new heavy ice flag was added to the DPR dataset
(Iguchi et al. 2018). Large ice particles can result in a strong Mie effect,
which deviates scattering from the simple Rayleigh one. Using the heavy ice
flag, a heavy ice precipitation band was detected in an extratropical cyclone
(Akiyama et al. 2019). Furthermore, in the bright band or the melting layer,
precipitating particles are large, and a significant Mie effect occurs, which
results in a difference between KuPR and KaPR radar echoes: therefore, another
application was designed to improve bright band detection (Le and Chandrasekar
2013a, b). The convective/stratiform rain type classification was improved by
using the improved bright band detection algorithm (Awaka et al. 2016). The third
objective (c) to provide accurate rain rate retrievals, is challenging, but
progress has been made (Seto and Iguchi 2011, 2015; Seto et al. 2013, 2021).
Conceptually, additional information in the difference between two profiles of
Ka- and Ku-band radiowaves can contribute to improvements in rain retrieval. As
the two beams of the radars are designed to match each other, the difference
occurs in relation to the frequency dependence of the scattering cross sections
of the precipitation particles and attenuation within the radio path. This
frequency difference appears as the Mie effect in the Ka-band, and the
difference depends on the DSD. Attenuation is mainly due to rain particles at
the Ka-band. If the Mie effect is ignored, the rain rate can be estimated from
the attenuation. The idea of obtaining rain rate estimates from rain
attenuation began in the 1970s for a ground-based radio path (Atlas and Ulbrich
1977). A modified method for a spaceborne radar using both Ka- and Ku-band rain

<p class=MsoNormal>profiles was proposed by Kozu and Nakamura (1991). However,
several obstacles remain: as the two profiles are similar, the resulting rain
rate is sensitive to small differences of the two reflectivity profiles that
occur because of the beam filling effect, the multi-scattering effect,
attenuation from non-precipitating materials, or deviation of the DSD from
assumed one. When precipitation is not uniformly distributed in radar pixels,
the simple dual-frequency technique contains biases (Nakamura 1991). Multiple
scattering is another problem. This is evident in data obtained from the
spaceborne W-band (94 GHz) cloud profiling radar onboard CLOUDSAT (Battaglia
and Simmer 2008) and is significant even in Ka-band radar images of heavy rain
(Battaglia et al. 2015). SRT has been improved using DPR surface signatures, as
surface signatures in the Ku- and Ka-band have good correlations, and PIA
estimations have been improved (Meneghini et al. 2012, 2015, 2021). The global
distribution of DSD became more precise using DPR data as shown in Fig. 17. The
coverage of the distribution of DSD was also extended to midlatitude regions.
The mass-weighted mean diameter and the precipitation rate show different
distributions, and it has been shown that estimated DSD variations are related
to the structure of the precipitation system (Yamaji et al. 2020). The DSD
variations at least partly explain the difference between </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the PR-estimated rain rate and the TMI-estimated rain rate.
Additionally, the DSD variations have been incorporated in the DPR rain
retrieval algorithm (Seto et al. 2021).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The KaPR has two scan modes: one is the matched scan, and
the other is high sensitivity scan. The pixels of the matched KaPR scan were
matched with those of the KuPR, and in the original scans of the DPR, high
sensitivity pixels were interlaced in the matched scan. After evaluating the
sensitivity of radars, the high sensitivity mode scan was moved to the outer
band of the normal scan of KuPR in May 2018, which resulted in the extension of
the KaPR swath. Thus, the swath in which dual-frequency data are available has
been expanded (Iguchi 2020).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The DPR uses the first-ever spaceborne Ka-band (35 GHz)
precipitation radar. However, the radiowave scattering characteristics of
precipitation particles are complex compared with those of other lower
frequency radiowaves. This difficulty is exacerbated for snow observations,
particularly, when observing melting snow, as shapes, densities, and water
mixing ratios vary widely (e.g., Liao et al. 2020). Although many model
calculations have been conducted to provide radiowave scattering
characteristics of snow particles or melting snow particles, uncertainty
remains. Ground observations are another method to investigate the scattering
characteristics, and JAXA developed a dual Ka-band radar system comprising
identically designed Ka-band radars to assist in this approach. By positioning
the radars to face each other, the precipitation system between the two radars
can be observed simultaneously by both radars. As rain attenuation is
significant in the Ka-band and radar signature weakens over longer ranges, equivalent
radar reflectivity and specific attenuation can be directly measured. Different
scattering characteristics of dry/wet snow and rain were obtained (Nishikawa et
al. 2016; Nakamura et al. 2018).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.3       Transition from PR to DPR</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TRMM’s PR was the first spaceborne radar, and its
operational period was extended from the original 3 to 17 years. Thanks to this
long observational period, climatological studies have been significantly
advanced. The GPM DPR is a new version of this spaceborne radar, and the
studies of precipitation trends in the climate change era are continuing.
However, to avoid the misidentification of climatological trends,
well-calibrated data are required. Several spaceborne Earth observation
instruments, such as microwave radiometers, have technological experiences to
continue data without gaps or jumps over multiple spaceborne radiometers,
whereas, for spaceborne precipitation radars, the only transition has been from
the PR to DPR. The PR itself had experienced problems with data continuity. In
2001, TRMM’s orbit was boosted from a height of 350&#8202;–&#8202;400 km to
extend its lifetime. The PR’s sensitivity and spatial resolution were altered
because of the change of the satellite altitude, and a small mismatch between
the transmitting pulse and the received radar echo also occurred. Nonetheless,
almost all of the deviations were recognized and understood in the statistics
of rain totals and storm height (Shimizu et al. 2009; Hirose et al. 2012;
Kanemaru et al. 2019). Another incident occurred in 2008 when a part of the PR
malfunctioned, and the part was switched to a redundant one. Slight variations
in the system parameters, such as noise levels, occurred. System calibration
was conducted using internal housekeeping data and a ground-based external
active calibrator that transmitted or received radiowaves to and from the PR
(Kanemaru et al. 2017; Masaki et al. 2020). The accuracy of data continuity was
subsequently evaluated and confirmed using the statistics of rain totals, storm
top height, and long-term rain total trends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The engineering calibration of the PR or DPR is performed to
ensure that it fluctuates by less than 1 dB in operation periods (Takahashi et
al. 2003; Shimizu et al. 2009). This long-term calibration stability is
remarkable and illustrates a considerable engineering success. However, the
accuracy is not yet sufficient for use in detecting climate change. The
fluctuations of 1 dB in radar reflectivity correspond to a rain rate of
approximately 15 %. Thus, another calibration is necessary. TRMM and GPM use
radar signatures of the sea surface with no rain to obtain precise radar beam
widths and pulse widths (Kanemaru et al. 2020).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The special operations of the PR were performed from October
2014 to January 2015 near the end of TRMM’s lifetime, which was determined by
the amount of fuel remaining (Takahashi et al. 2016; Takahashi 2017). During
normal observations, the PR beam scanned cross-track directions, and the scan
angles were limited. Near the end of the mission, the altitude of the satellite
decreased, and the normal operational data were not available. In this period,
wide scan operations, dense observations, and a 90° yaw maneuver were
performed. The wide scan operation was conducted to investigate surface clutter
interference. When the radar beam had a large incidence angle, surface clutter
contamination is significant, and this is one of the factors preventing
observations at large incidence angles. The result showed that, although
surface clutter was broadened and contaminated the precipitation echo at
incidence angles far from nadir, the intensity of the surface echo was reduced.
The result suggested that the use of a wide-angle scan may be possible when
moderate to heavy rain is being measured (Yamamoto et al. 2020). During dense
observations, the beam scanned only near nadir angles and one location on the
Earth’s surface was observed with fine spacing oversampled data. In the normal
scan of the PR, the pixels were separated with the radar beamwidth, but a
better spatial resolution could be obtained from oversampled data. The 90° yaw
maneuver operation showed a better relationship between surface signatures and
incidence angles. In the normal cross-track scan, different surfaces were
observed with different incidence angles, but in the 90° yaw maneuver, the scan
became along-track, and fixed-point signatures with different incidence angles
were obtained in approximately 30 s. This provided data for studying SRT
uncertainty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.4       Applications</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Several applications using precipitation data from
satellites, which were in the test and validation phase during the TRMM era,
have become operational in the GPM era. Water vapor or precipitable water
obtained from microwave radiometers, particularly, over oceans is important for
weather forecasts, and these data had been assimilated in numerical models.
Although water vapor data from microwave radiometers predated TRMM was used,
data from TRMM TMI and later GPM GMI have been added to the assimilation suite.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to assimilate precipitation because the
distribution of precipitation has fine spatial variation and spatial mismatches
with the model likely cause errors. Thus, a spatial matching method has been
developed (Aonashi et al. 2011), and the technique is presently operationally
applied. Studies have also attempted to assimilate the vertical profile of
precipitation from DPR (Aonashi et al. 2011; Okamoto et al. 2016; Ikuta 2016;
Ikuta et al. 2020). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The development of atmospheric models has been remarkable,
partly thanks to the enormous expansion in computer power, such as the Earth
Simulator of the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology. At the
start of the TRMM era, the spatial resolution of global atmospheric models was
typically 100 km, but the spatial resolution of satellite observations was
typically a few tens of kilometers. Today, the global model resolution is
superior to that of satellite observations (e.g., Satoh et al. 2014). The model
is non- hydrostatic and does not use cumulus parameterization, thus, the model
results can be directly compared with satellite observations, which greatly
assists in the validation or evaluation of model results (e.g., Kotsuki et al.
2014).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The improvements made in compiling global precipitation maps
enable the maps to be used in flood forecast, and in this respect, the
Integrated Flood Analysis System was developed in the International Centre for
Water Hazard and Risk Management, Japan (https://www.pwri.go.jp/icharm/research/ifas/)
(Tsuda et al. 2014; Kidd et al. 2020a). This system uses global precipitation
from GSMaP as the primary input data and forecasts river discharge using
hydrological models. The alert maps and information are available on the
websites of the Global Flood Alert System or the International Flood Network. A
parallel system, the Global Flood Monitoring System developed in the United
States, uses IMERG data as the input data (Wu et al. 2014). Global
precipitation maps are also used to detect extremes and droughts on the basis
of long-term observation data (e.g., Kuleshov et al. 2020; Tashima et al.
2020).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With improvements in the reliability of the satellite rain
maps, associated applications have greatly expanded. One example is an
application for dengue fever outbreaks. Mosquitoes are vectors of dengue fever,
and their populations depend on water. Precipitation data can thus be used to
investigate the relationship between precipitation and dengue fever outbreaks
(e.g., Igarashi et al. 2014; Pham et al. 2018). The relationship between
cholera outbreak and precipitation was also studied (Japan Aerospace Exploration
Agency 2019).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The global rain distribution is also used to monitor global
crop harvest. Although the growth of the crops is mainly monitored by infrared
radiometers, crop yields depend on rain, and precipitation is thus one of the
important data to enable accurate crop yield prediction to be made (Oyoshi et
al. 2016; Kidd et al. 2020a). Additionally, hydropower is an important energy
source in mountainous countries, and when the regions are poorly
precipitation-gauged, global precipitation maps can be used to make assessments
of suitable hydropower locations (Mori et al. 2020). Furthermore, the global
precipitation maps can be used for the weather derivative in insurance
applications (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency 2019). As such, global
precipitation maps are now part of the international infrastructure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.         Beyond GPM </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the TRMM successor discussions were initiated once TRMM’s
success was apparent, discussions regarding new precipitation measurements
after GPM have already begun (Battaglia et al. 2020). Long-term climate records
are essential for conducting climate studies, and the importance of data
continuity is strongly emphasized during all Earth observation satellite
discussions. Technological developments are continually made, and new
instruments have improved capabilities that provide new data and enable new findings.
Hence, a new Earth observation satellite must provide (a) continuity of the
physical data from instruments that include the capability of the previous
instruments and (b) data from new instruments. The emphasis ultimately depends
on the funding agencies. JMA or NOAA, being operational agencies, may emphasize
(a), whereas NASA and JAXA are research and development agencies and they may
emphasize (b). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although global precipitation observations are being
continuously improved, there remains a long way to go. Some targets for future
developments are described as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(a)       To provide precise rain totals needed for
detecting changes in the global rain accumulations occurring within the context
of global climate change </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The global rain total over land has increased by nearly 1 %
in the last 100 years. According to the Clausius–Clapeyron law, an increase of
1 K corresponds to a few percent increase in saturated water vapor pressure. In
this respect, precipitable water has shown an increasing trend consistent with
surface temperature increases, particularly over the ocean (IPCC 2013). Hence,
if the cycling speed or resident time of water vapor in the atmosphere does not
change, the amount of total precipitation would increase by a few percent.
However, despite surface temperature increase, GPCP data from post-1979 show
only a weak increasing trend in global total rain. It has increased in tropical
regions, but the increase has been offset by a decrease in extratropical regions.
(Gu et al. 2007; Adler et al. 2008). For better understandings of the trend of
the global rain totals, precise rain total data are required (e.g., De Meyer
and Roca 2021). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(b)       To provide higher temporal and spatial resolution
precipitation maps</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the era of rapid atmospheric model improvements,
spatiotemporal resolutions of the observations from space must be at least
compatible with those of models to enable the model result to be evaluated or
validated. A higher resolution is also required to provide precise rain total
estimates for local precipitation characteristics. For real applications, such
as shortrange flood forecasts, current spatial and temporal resolutions are too
poor. An example is river discharge prediction. Precipitation over land is
strongly affected by topography, and precipitation over one side of a mountain
ridge has big impacts on river discharge relative to when precipitation occurs
over the other side of the ridge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(c)       To attain precise measurements of water equivalent
solid precipitation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>High latitude regions experience solid precipitation. To
close the water budget of the global water cycle, water equivalent solid
precipitation measurements are required, although there are low total amounts
of precipitation at high latitudes. For the snow measurements from space, the
microwave signature of snow is weak, and backscattering cross-sections are
small. Additionally, snow particles, particularly, melting snow particles have
a wide range in size, and their permittivity differs because of the mixing
ratios of ice, water, and air. Thus, snowfall measurements remain a challenge.
Even on the ground, snowfall measurements have large uncertainty related to
variation in the gauge catchment ratio due to wind or the mixing of ground snow
blown by wind. This fact gives another problem for the validation of the
snowfall measurements from space.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Presently, there are two major pathways for defining the
objectives of a potential DPR successor. The first one is to understand the
interactions between aerosols, clouds, and precipitation. Aerosols act as the
nuclei of water vapor condensation and produce cloud particles, and the
capability of aerosols to produce cloud particles depends on their size,
chemical properties, and the water vapor saturation ratio and temperature. For
example, generally, high number densities of aerosols result in a large number
of small cloud particles that suppress precipitation (Rosenfeld 1999). This
mission pathway includes an aim to understand the conversion mechanism from
clouds to rain. It also addresses the effect of cloud properties on the
radiation budget to enable accurate climate change modeling. The original
mission concept was proposed in the US decadal survey for Earth Science and
Applications from Space (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine 2019), and it evolved to the more comprehensive Aerosol, Cloud,
Convection, and Precipitation Study. The other major pathway aims to gain a
better understanding of the global water cycle. Precipitation is a crucial
component, and accurate and precise measurements of precipitation are required.
Although data from TRMM and GPM and combinations of other data have
dramatically improved the ability to obtain global precipitation amounts,
uncertainty remains. To improve the accuracy, global coverage that includes
high latitude regions, and accurate water equivalent snow measurements are
required. Currently, one of the biggest obstacles to improving the accuracy of
rain totals is the sampling frequency of satellite observations. To overcome
this obstacle, a core observatory with constellation satellites as with GPM is
necessary. This core observatory should be equipped with an advanced
precipitation radar in the Ku-band that has better sensitivity and a wider
swath than the DPR. Current advanced precipitation radar studies have suggested
that better sensitivity can be attained using final stage high power
amplifiers, and a larger antenna than PR or DPR (Kummerow et al. 2020). The
larger antenna enables Doppler measurements to be conducted. The Doppler
function is a promising new capability to measure the vertical velocity of
precipitation particles at nadir. Obtaining the vertical velocity would assist
in precipitation particle discrimination and in the characterization of
dynamical structures of precipitation systems. It would also contribute to
improving the latent heating estimation, as heating is correlated with the
vertical air motion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The importance of spaceborne precipitation radars is well
recognized, but other technologies perhaps must be developed, rather than
continually upgrading current technology. This could be achieved using small
satellites. The development of big satellites is extremely expensive and
time-consuming, and observations using a large number of small satellites could
mitigate the low sampling frequency problem (e.g., Yamaji et al. 2019). One
example is that of the US RainCube (Peral et al. 2019), which is a Ka-band
fixed beam radar system onboard a small satellite that was released from the
International Space Station in 2018. RainCube is a 35 GHz radar with a 0.5 m
antenna. It demonstrated the technological feasibility of using a small
low-cost satellite. However, the performance of the instrument onboard the
small satellite is limited, and a reference standard such as the GPM core
observatory may still be required. Another challenging idea is to use a large
radar in a geostationary orbit (Im et al. 2004). This concept was initiated in
the 1980s (Gogineni and Moore 1989). Precipitation could be observed almost
continuously from the geostationary orbit in a similar manner to the
geostationary meteorological satellites, thus solving the sampling problem. To
obtain sufficient spatial resolution, a Ku-band active array radar system using
an antenna measuring 30 m by 30 m is currently studied in JAXA (Okazaki et al.
2019).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5.         Conclusions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TRMM was launched in 1997 and provided the global
distribution of rain with significantly improved accuracy. TRMM paved the way
for two types of studies: global precipitation system climatology, and
precipitation measurement technology from space. Before the advent of TRMM,
precipitation science had focused on the occurrence and distribution of
precipitation using ground observations that include the use of 3D structures
from radars. The ground observations enabled the identification of many types
of precipitation systems, such as tall convection, wide extended stratiform,
shallow orographic, and large precipitation associated with frontal activities.
Previous studies had also focused on the internal structure of 3D precipitating
particle distribution, and the corresponding air motions in different
precipitation types. However, almost all observations were limited to local
scales, and global precipitation observations were mainly limited to the
distribution of rain on the ground. Global 3D structure observations of TRMM
overcame these limitations at least partly, although coverage was limited in
tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GPM is the formal successor of TRMM. GPM has expanded
coverage to ±65° in latitude and includes measurements of solid precipitation.
The GPM core observatory has been providing data for more than 6 years since
its launch in 2014 and is currently healthy. Along with the 17 year data of
TRMM, precipitation data obtained from space are essential for studying climate
change. Studies on precipitation system climatology can now be extended to high
latitudes. Over tropical regions, the Coriolis parameter is small and the
divergence and convergence of the flow are of primary importance in the
atmospheric dynamics. By contrast, from mid- to high latitude regions, the
Coriolis parameter is large, and vorticities are of primary importance. This
fact characterizes the dynamical structure of tropical and extratropical
atmosphere (e.g., Satoh et al. 2008; Matsuno 2016). It is said that tropical
regions are the Velocity Potential (VP) World, whereas the extratropical
regions are Potential Vorticity (PV) World. In the VP world, latent heat
release associated with precipitation is the major driving force of atmospheric
disturbances, whereas in the PV world, baroclinicity is the major cause of
disturbances, and precipitation is generally a consequence of disturbances. In
tropical regions, typical precipitation systems are squall lines, vigorous tall
convections, superclusters, and tropical depressions. In extratropical regions,
precipitation associated with extratropical depressions and frontal systems is
much more important, whereas that associated with polar lows and shallow
convections induced by cold air outbreaks also frequently occur. Therefore,
types of precipitation systems can be more widely identified and refined using
GPM data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the basis of the remarkable progress of atmospheric
models, satellite data can be merged or assimilated in global numerical models,
and comprehensive datasets can be generated. Datasets naturally include
precipitation information, and data are consistent under model assumptions;
thus, reasonably good datasets are currently provided about Earth’s atmospheric
environment. There remains a demand for datasets that are independent of model
outputs, and observations with higher accuracy and better spatiotemporal
resolutions are still required.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rapid progress in the increase of computer power has opened
new avenues with respect to the use of artificial intelligent technology (AI),
such as deep learning, neural networks, and random forest. AI has been widely
tested for use with retrieval algorithms of Earth observations from space,
particularly in land cover identifications, and has also been applied in global
precipitation mapping (e.g., Sorooshian et al. 2000; Nguyen et al. 2018; Hirose
et al. 2019). Although AI has potential, however, it has limitations in that
the results are sometimes difficult to interpret.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Several books on precipitation measurements from space have
been published to date. For example, “Tropical Rainfall Measurements” (Theon
and Fugono 1988) was published in 1988, before the launch of TRMM, “Measuring
Precipitation from Space” (Levizzani et al. 2007) was published in 2007 while
TRMM was in orbit, and recently, “Precipitation Measurement from Space”
(Levizzani et al. 2020a, b) has been published. These books represent the
remarkable progress of the precipitation measurements from space.</p>

are widely used in the fields of meteorology and hydrology because they can
provide physical, spatial, and temporal coherent long time series at a global
scale. Nevertheless, as a pre-requisite for many applications their performance
needs to be assessed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) latest fifth-generation
reanalysis precipitation products, i.e., ERA5 and ERA5-Land, at country scale
in Spain. For doing so, we compared it against a high- resolution precipitation
product of the Spanish Meteorological Agency which spans approximately 70 years
(1951–2020). A comprehensive assessment (continuous, categorical, probability
distribution function (pdf), spatial pattern, and temporal trend) was performed
in order to ascertain the quality of the reanalysis products. Results of the
analysis revealed a general agreement between observations and ERA5-Land/ERA5
estimates: spearman correlation values between 0.5 and 0.9, Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) mostly between 2 and 8 mm/ d and Kling Gupta Efficiency (KGE)
values &gt;0.4. Categorical assessment additionally indicated a good
performance (Heiken Skill score (HSS) score, also known as kappa, between 0.4
and 0.8). Nevertheless, performance was found to be dependent on the climatic
region, precipitation intensity and orography. Correlation revealed a
north-west (higher values) south-east (lower values) spatial gradient while
relative bias (RBIAS) and RMSE spatial patterns were positively correlated with
slope (&#961; = 0.41/0.35, 0.69/0.70, respectively). In addition, as </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            indicated by the categorical analysis, along the
Mediterranean coast a wet bias (i.e., overestimation of days with
precipitation) was found. Reanalysis detection capacity (kappa) shown a
negative correlation with the slope (&#961; = &#8722; 0.29/&#8722; 0.34). Worst
model performance is obtained during summer months, with a generalized
overestimation. The pdf assessment revealed that the ERA5-Land/ERA5 tended to
overestimate light (&#8805;1 and &lt; 5 mm/day), and moderate (&#8805;5 and
&lt; 20 mm/day) precipitation categories while underestimating the heavy
(&#8805;20 and &lt; 40 mm/ day) and violent (&#8805;40 mm/day) categories.
Moderate precipitation provided the best detection capacity, as indicated by
the precipitation-intensity analysis. ERA5-Land/ERA5 showed a good capacity to
reproduce the spatial patterns and temporal trends of the observations.
ERA5-Land and ERA5, with a different spatial resolution, performed very similar
in all the analysis considered. Mediterranean and northern coast were
highlighted as the most critical for reanalysis modelling purposes because of
its performance.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. Introduction </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reliable and accurate precipitation information of fine
spatio- temporal resolution is of paramount importance for many applications in
the fields of hydrology, meteorology, climatology, natural hazards management,
and human activities (Ebert et al., 2007; Piao et al., 2010; Robertson et al.,
2013; He et al., 2020; Salazar-Galan et al., 2021´ ). Nevertheless, the spatial
estimation of this variable is challenging both because of its spatio-temporal
heterogeneity and the diverse physical processes involved (Tapiador et al.,
2012; Nogueira, 2020). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Atmospheric reanalysis result from the combination of
observations from multiple variables and numerical weather forecasts using data
assimilation methods (Hu et al., 2019). They can provide physical, spatial, and
temporal coherent continuous long records of multiple climate variables,
including precipitation (Sun et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2019). Thus, they can be
considered a potential alternative to ground- based observations especially in
ungauged or poor-gauged regions (Amjad et al., 2020). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Overview of the precipitation datasets used in this study.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the last few years, significant progress has been made in
the development of global reanalysis systems. The National Center for
Environment Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR)
released the NCEP1 (Kalnay et al., 1996) and NCEP2 (Kanamitsu et al., 2002)
with a spatial resolution of 2.5&#9702;x2.5&#9702; and
1.875&#9702;x1.875&#9702;, respectively. The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) Global Modelling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) released
the MERRA reanalysis (Rienecker et al., 2011), which was replaced by the
MERRA-2 (Gelaro et al., 2017), both at a resolution of 0.5&#9702;x0.67&#9702;.
The Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) provided the Japanese 55-year
Reanalysis (JRA-55; Ebita et al., 2011) with 1.25&#9702;x1.25&#9702; spatial
resolution and overcame the deficiencies of the first reanalysis project. The
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) released several
reanalysis products: ERA-15 (Gibson et al., 1999), ERA-40 (Uppala et al.,
2005), ERA-Interim (Dee et al., 2011), and recently, the fifth generation,
i.e., ERA5 (Hersbach et al., 2020) followed by ERA5-Land (Munoz-Sabater et al.,
2021˜ ). They feature temporal and spatial resolution easily competitive with
satellite-based precipitation estimates (Munoz-Sabater et al., 2021˜ ). These
two come at 1 h temporal resolution and 0.25&#9702;x0.25&#9702; and
0.1&#9702;x0.1&#9702; spatial resolution, respectively. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reanalysis are influenced by both model and observations
errors (Bosilovich et al., 2008). In addition, model performance can be
influenced also by orography incorrectness, data assimilation and
parametrization of small-scale processes (Bli&#711;zn&#711;ak et al., 2022´ ).
Comprehensive evaluation of reanalysis precipitation thus becomes essential
prior to any further use and many studies have been devoted to the evaluation
of these datasets at global and regional levels. Amongst the different
agencies' reanalysis products, ERA-Interim has been generally considered to
provide the best performance in precipitation estimation (Beck et al., 2017,
2019; Wang et al., 2019). Recent studies conclude that in fact, new ECMWF
releases (i.e., ERA5 and ERA5-Land) outperform its predecessor ERA-Interim
(Beck et al., 2019; Amjad et al., 2020; Gleixner et al., 2020; Hamm et al.,
2020; Nogueira, 2020). The evaluation of these ECMWF products considering
national/regional networks or under a hydrological modelling framework highlighted
that ERA5 and ERA5-Land estimates are not free from associated uncertainties
(Beck et al., 2019; Sharifi et al., 2019; Amjad et al., 2020; Kolluru et al.,
2020; Tang et al., 2020; Tarek et al., 2020; Bandhauer et al., 2022; Hafizi and
Sorman, 2022; Xu et al., 2022). Despite its capability of capturing
precipitation events and reproducing the spatio-temporal distribution of this
variable, biases are reported in most analyses and performance is also affected
by complex orography. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Spain country, precipitation features a high spatial and
temporal variability because of a complex orography and diverse atmospheric
regimes (Serrano et al., 1999) influenced by both Atlantic and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mediterranean climates. On the one hand, this fact makes it
highly advisable to evaluate the strengths and limitations of any reanalysis/
satellite water cycle estimates before its use (Tapiador et al., 2020;
Gomis-Cebolla et al., 2022). On the other hand, these rich climatic conditions
make this region a perfect candidate for spatial analysis of the precipitation
(Cortesi et al., 2014). In fact, Beck et al. (2019) identified that the
generalizability of the findings of many studies was limited due to the consideration
of small regions, which feature low spatial variability. So far, studies
evaluating the performance of reanalysis precipitation products over the
region, in particular ECMWF fifth generation, have been scarce. H´enin et al.
(2018) evaluated ERA5 in the analysis of extreme precipitation events over the
Iberian Peninsula. Tapiador et al. (2020) considered ERA5 as verification of
IMERG satellite-based precipitation. In this study, with a similar approach
followed in Belo-Pereira et al. (2011), Henin et al. (2018)´ , Beck et al.
(2019), Tapiador et al. (2020), Jiang et al. (2021), Bandhauer et al. (2022)
amongst others, we used a high-quality km-scale gridded precipitation product
in order to evaluate ECMWF precipitation estimates. This reference precipitation
dataset (Peral García et al., 2017) is provided by the Spanish Meteorological
Agency and spans approximately 70 years. It has been considered as a benchmark
in several hydrological applications (Senent-Aparicio et al., 2018, 2021). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to deeply understand the ERA5-Land/ERA5 skills we
performed a comprehensive assessment which consisted in a continuous (spearman
rank correlation, RBIAS, RMSE and KGE), categorical (probability of detection
(POD), false alarm ratio (FAR) and HSS), pdf (histograms and Epps-Singleton
test), spatial patterns (spatial pattern efficiency (SPAEF) an EOF analysis)
and temporal trend (Mann's Kendall) analysis. In addition, we assessed the
error dependency by precipitation intensity and orography. Depending on the
analysis, multiple </p>

mountains (across northern Spain), the Betic system (southeast), the Meseta
Central, which is crossed by the Central system, the Iberian System, which
extends from the eastern part of the Cantabrian Mountains to the Betic system.
There are two important depressions, the Ebro River in the east and the Guadalquivir
River in the southwest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The climate of the country is highly diverse due to the
orography and the spatial location between the Atlantic Ocean and the
Mediterranean Sea (Serrano et al., 1999). Regarding rainfall regime, there is a
sizeable latitudinal gradient in precipitation generally decreasing from north
to south and from west to east, with many areas of high/low precipitation
inserted in regions with opposite signs (de Castro et al., 2005). Hence, the
north and north-western parts are the most humid, with mean annual precipitations
records up to 2300 mm/year, while the southeast experiences 200 mm/year values
(Fig. 1b). Overall, the period from October to March corresponds with more
significant concentration of precipitation. Summer (June to August) is the less
rainy period (Fig. 1c). The intensity of the precipitation is higher on the
coast, especially on the Mediterranean coast according to the Climate Atlas of
Spain (see htt p://atlasnacional.ign.es/wane/Clima). 3. Datasets </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.1. Observed precipitation datasets </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> The Spanish Meteorological Agency, with the objective of
climate monitoring, provides a high resolution gridded (5 km × 5 km in rotated
grid) daily precipitation product spanning the 1951–2020 period. Precipitation
estimates were produced using the optimal interpolation method and considering
the Surface Parameters Analysis (SPAN) system (Rodríguez et al., 2003;
Navascues et al., 2003´ ; Quintana-Seguí et al., 2016) which was appropriately
adjusted to represent the structures of 24 h precipitation at the scale allowed
by the density of stations (Peral García et al., 2017). A total of
approximately 3236 gauges stations across peninsular Spain and Balearic Islands
were considered in the analysis. Precipitation estimates represent the
precipitation accumulated between 07 UTC of day n and 07 UTC of day n + 1
(Peral García et al., 2017). Details of the products are summarised in Table 1.
This dataset is used as a benchmark to evaluate the ERA5 and ERA5-Land
performance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.2. ERA5 reanalysis precipitation datasets </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ERA5 is the fifth generation of the ECMWF reanalysis. It is
based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2. Measurements from
different observations systems (satellite, in-situ data, etc.) are integrated
into the atmospheric model using a 4D-Var scheme (Hersbach et al., 2020). It
also provides a physically consistent analysis of the land surface and ocean by
coupling the atmospheric part of the IFS with the land- surface model HTESSEL
and the ocean wave model (WAM). ERA5 resolves the atmosphere using 137 hybrid
sigma/pressure (model) levels from the surface up to 1 Pa. The grid resolution
is 31 km (0.218125&#9702;). Data are available hourly and consist of analysis
and short forecasts, which run twice daily from 06 and 18 UTC. Uncertainty
estimates for all variables are also provided at a reduced spatial and temporal
resolution. ERA5 provides global spatial coverage from 1950 until the present. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ERA5-Land is a spatially enhanced version (9 km). It results
from forcing the HTESSEL land surface component (version Cy45r1 of the IFS)
with low atmospheric meteorological fields from ERA5. Observations only
influence the simulation indirectly through the forcing, no atmospheric/oceanic
coupling or data assimilation scheme is considered (Munoz-Sabater et al., 2021˜
) This is achieved in order to dispose of a computational affordable updateable
version. Data are provided from 1950 to the present at an hourly resolution
over land regions (i.e., all oceans are masked). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both reanalyses are available from the Copernicus Climate
data store. These products come interpolated at a regular latitude/longitude
grid (netcdf format) of 0.25&#9702; x 0.25&#9702; and 0.1&#9702; x 0.1&#9702;
for the case of ERA5 and ERA5-Land, respectively. In this study, we downloaded
hourly forecast precipitation data (total precipitation) for the study period
(1951–2020) over peninsular Spain. Details of the products are summarised in
Table 1. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4. Methods </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.1. Pre-processing of the datasets </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ERA5 and ERA5-Land datasets, available at hourly timesteps,
were aggregated to obtain daily time step values matching the observed gridded
products time observations (07 h UTC to 07 h UTC). In addition, to enable a
consistent comparison, AEMET dataset was resampled to </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>0.1&#9702; (0.25&#9702;) grid-cell size for ERA5-Land (ERA5)
respectively. Prior to this step, AEMET rotated grid was resampled to a regular
0.05&#9702; grid using nearest neighbour interpolation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Table 2 summarizes the statistics considered in the
continuous analysis. The spearman rank correlation (&#961;) provides an
assessment of how well the relationships between two variables can be described
using a monotonic function. Contrary to commonly applied correlation
coefficient, this non-parametric statistic does not require data to be normally
distributed. RBIAS describes the systematic bias of precipitation estimates,
underestimation (RBIAS&gt;0%) or overestimation (RBIAS&lt;0%). RMSE is able to
quantitatively represent the error characteristics between reanalysis estimates
and observed data. KGE provides a measure of model performance considering the
mean, the variability and the temporal dynamics. The non-parametric version
described in Pool et al. (2018) was considered in this study. These statistics
were calculated at daily, monthly and yearly timesteps for the period 1951–2020
using hydroeval package (Hallouin, 2021). Temporal evolution of these
statistics was calculated over climatic regions which were defined by applying
a k-means clustering to AEMET monthly precipitation anomaly time series. In
order to set the appropriate number of clusters we used the heuristic elbow
method (i.e. plotting the explained variation as a function of the number of
clusters and check for the elbow of the curve) (Manzano et al., 2019) (Fig.
S1). The resulting precipitation regions agree with those proposed in previous
works (Belo-Pereira et al., 2011; Manzano et al., 2019). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.3. Categorical assessment </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Precipitation event detection was assessed considering the
statistics listed in Table 2. The Probability Of Detection (POD) and False
Alarm Ratio (FAR) represents the ratio of correctly or falsely detected
precipitation occurrences by the reanalysis to the total number of detected
precipitation occurrences. Heidke skill score (HSS), known also as Cohen's
Kappa, measures the classification accuracy relative to that expected by
chance. Categorical indices were derived considering the confusion matrix in Table
3. Chi Square test of independence was additionally used in order to check the
statistical relationship between the datasets. Categorical assessment was
obtained for the 1951–2020 period considering data at daily timesteps only.
Event threshold was set to 1 mm/day (Chen et al., 2020; Xin et al., 2021). Same
climatic regions as Section 4.2 were considered for temporal evolution
assessment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.4. PDF assessment </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fig. 8. ERA5-Land SPAEF daily (a) and monthly (b) values.
Outliers are not shown.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The capability of the reanalysis estimates to reproduce the
frequency distribution of the observed data was obtained by comparing the
histograms of both datasets under different precipitation intensity levels.
Daily based events were discretized into five threshold (Acharya et al., 2019;
Amjad et al., 2020). They are: no precipitation (NP) (&lt; 1 mm/ day), light
precipitation (LP) (&#8805;1 and &lt; 5 mm/day), moderate precipitation (MP)
(&#8805;5 and &lt; 20 mm/day), heavy precipitation (HP) (&#8805;20 and &lt; 40
mm/day) and violent precipitation (VP) (&#8805;40 mm/day). In addition to this,
we also applied the Epps-Singleton test. It is based on the empirical
characteristic function and has shown a higher power than the traditional
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in many applications (Epps and Singleton, 1986). Under
the null hypothesis the test demonstrate that observed and reanalysis estimates
come from the same continuous distribution. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.5. Spatial pattern evaluation </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The capability of the reanalysis in order to reproduce the
precipitation spatial distribution (i.e., spatial patterns) was assessed using
SPAEF statistic (Table 2) and EOF analysis. SPAEF considers three equally
weighted components: spatial correlation coefficient (&#961;SP), the fraction
of the coefficient of variation (&#946;SP) which provides a representation of
the spatial variability and histogram overlap (&#945;SP) which helps to
emphasize non-existing spatial variability between regions of high and low
values (Koch et al., 2018). &#945;SP is computed considering z-scores in order
to ensure bias insensitivity. We replaced the correlation coefficient by
spearman rank correlation in order to consider the non-normality of the
precipitation. SPAEF statistic was calculated over the region of study at
daily/monthly/yearly timesteps. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis is able to
decompose a spatio-temporal dataset into a set of orthogonal spatial patterns
(EOFs) along with a time series of coefficients (principal components, PCs)
that control their time variation. In addition, they do also provide a measure
of the importance of each pattern (variance explained). In this way the
dimensionality of the dataset is reduced to a small number of representative
components. EOF analysis was applied in T-mode in order to focus on the identification
of spatial patterns. Analysis was performed considering monthly and daily
timesteps. The time and space average of the precipitation data has been
subtracted from the product considered before the EOF analysis. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.6. Temporal trends </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fig. 9. First (a), second (b) and third (c) EOFs for
ERA5-Land and ERA5 considering monthly time series. Associated number refers to
the variance explained.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Similarities and differences in the temporal trends of the
datasets were assessed considering non-parametric Mann's Kendall test and Sen's
slope estimator. In Mann's Kendall test, the null hypothesis (H0) indicates
no-trend presence, while the alternate hypothesis (H1) indicates monotonic
trend (increasing or decreasing). While no assumption about the data
distribution is needed, the test requires the data to be serially independent.
In order to reduce the impact of autocorrelation two approaches have been suggested
in the literature: variance correction (explicit calculation of the inflated
variance) and prewhitening method (removing the lag-1 autoregressive process).
In this study, Hamed (2009) and Yue and Wang (2002) methods, being
representative of both approaches, were also applied as an independent
verification of the effect of serial autocorrelation. Both provide a modified
Sen's slope. They are available from the Modifiedmk R package (Patakamuri and
O'Brien, 2021), Trend analysis was applied independently to AEMET and ERA
reanalysis precipitation time series considering seasonal and yearly total
amounts. Seasons were defined as: winter (DJF), spring (MAM), summer (JJA) and
autumn (SON). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.7. Error dependency with precipitation intensity and
orography </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The influence of precipitation intensity on model
performance was assessed by analysing continuous (&#961;, RBIAS, RMSE and KGE)
and categorical metrics (POD and FAR) across the previous precipitation
categories (Section 4.3). In this case, hits represent the matches between
AEMET and ERA5-Land/ERA5 for a specific category, while false alarm or misses
represent the totality of the non-matches across the different categories (see
Table S1 in supplementary material). Precipitation categories were defined from
observational AEMET. Assessment was performed considering daily timestep values
over the 1951–2020 period. Influence of orography was assessed by calculating
the spatial spearman correlation between the RBIAS/RMSE/KGE/&#954; metrics and
elevation (m) / slope (%). Results were provided at country and climatic region
level. Boxplots were considered for visual representation of the relationships.
Elevation was obtained from Spanish Geographic Institute at 200 m. QGIS v3.26.1
('Buenos Aires') was used to calculate the slope. Both raster images were
resampled using spatial averaging to 0.1&#9702; (ERA5-Land) and 0.25&#9702;
(ERA5) spatial resolution. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5. Results </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5.1. Continuous assessment </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spearman correlation (Fig. 2a) and KGE (Fig. 2d) show a
spatial gradient from north-west (highest values) to south-east (lowest
values). KGE however provides a more complex spatial pattern with poor KGE
performance in inner locations of the country apart from the eastern coast. The
coexistence of regions of opposite sign in small regions (the Pyrenees and the
Central System) difficult the regional characterization of RBIAS (Fig. 2b).
Nevertheless, predominant areas of underestimation/overestimation are located
in the N/NE. RMSE (Fig. 2c) lowest values (2 mm/d to 4 mm/d) are spatially
distributed mostly in the centre of the country. Highest values (up to 12 mm/d)
are distributed also across the borders of the country with special emphasis
over the N region. Monthly and yearly analysis (Fig. S2 and S3) generally
reproduce the same spatial patterns of the daily assessment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Worst model performance is observed during the
June–September months as shown by the decrease in KGE (Fig. 3d) and spearman
correlation (Fig. 3a) (KGE/spearman median values ranging approximately from
0.2/0.4 to 0.5/0.7). The spatial gradient in Fig. 2 persists for these two
statistics during all the year. Nevertheless, SW ranks worse or similar to SE
for the July–August months. General overestimation is also observed during
these months and along all the year for NE region (Fig. 3b). Largest underestimation
is provided by N region during November – February months. Overall, RMSE (Fig.
3c) peak at the end of the year (N-NW-SW in November, NE in September and SE in
October). Monthly RMSE variability is also greater for this period and during
winter months (January–April) for N and NW. Conclusions derived from this
analysis still hold true when considering monthly analysis (Fig. S4). ERA5
analysis results are analogous (Fig. S5 and S6). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5.2. Categorical assessment </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A fair agreement is observed between the two datasets (0.4
&lt; &#954; &lt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>0.8) (Fig. 4c). Nevertheless, north and centre of the
country (N, NW and SW) generally provide a better detection capability (Fig.
4a) and a lower number of false alarm events (Fig. 4b) than the eastern coast
(NE and SE). Significant statistical relationship is confirmed by the Chi
Square </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Fig. S7) test of independence (all pixels having values of
p-value &lt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>0.05). Chi square statistic provides a similar spatial
distribution to Kappa statistic. Both statistics indicate a substantial
agreement (0.6 &lt; &#954; &lt; 0.8) for NW and SW while a moderate agreement
(0.4 &lt; &#954; &lt; 0.6) for SE and NE (Fig. 4c). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fig. 10. AEMET, ERA-Land and ERA5 annual (a) and seasonal
(b-e) Sen's slope (mm/y).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Same conclusions as in the continuous assessment are
obtained for the temporal evolution of statistics: worse performance (i.e.,
lower POD (Fig. 5a) and Kappa (Fig. 5c) and higher FAR (Fig. 5c)) obtained
during summer months (June–September) and similar spatial gradient which
persists along the year. Analogous conclusions are obtained for ERA5
categorical analysis (Fig. S8). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5.3. PDF assessment </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Overall, it is observed ERA5-Land generally reproduces the
frequency distribution of AEMET dataset in terms of spatial location (Fig. 6a)
but not in terms of magnitude (Fig. 6b). Generally, ERA5-Land tends to
underestimate the NP/HP/VP categories, while overestimating the LP/MP. NP
provides the greatest deviation. For the different regions, NW and SW tend to
provide a better performance (i.e., less underestimation/overestimation) than
the N, NE and SE (Fig. 6b). N provides the greatest deviation for the HP and VP
categories. N and SE show signs of underestimation (Fig. 6b). ERA5 pdf
assessment is displayed in Fig. S9. Analogous conclusions are obtained. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fig. 7 displays the result of the ERA5-Land and ERA5
Epps-Singleton statistic test. No statistically significant (at 95%) agreement
between pdf is obtained. The eastern coast of Spain together with part of the
northern region provides the major discrepancy amongst the AEMET and ERA5- Land
probability distribution functions thus confirming previous findings from Fig.
6. </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5.4. Spatial pattern evaluation </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ERA5-Land properly reproduces the spatial patterns provided
by AEMET at both daily (Fig. 8a) and monthly (Fig. 8b) timesteps
(SPAEF&gt;0.5). All the three components confirm the good performance. Greater
variability and lower SPAEF values are observed at daily scale. Seasonal
dynamics is not as pronounced as in the continuous and categorical assessment.
A proper reproduction of the spatial patterns (SPAEF values in the range
[0.60–0.90]) is also obtained at the yearly timescale. ERA5 analysis (Fig. S10)
provides analogous findings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fig. 9 displays the EOFs for both AEMET and ERA5-Land/ERA5
at monthly scale (daily scale results in Fig. S11). The resulting spatio-
temporal decomposition of AEMET and ERA5-Land/ERA5 is similar. Main
discrepancies arise at the third EOF (Fig. 9c). AEMET EOF is spatially more
enhanced than ERA5 and ERA5-Land, with a special emphasis over the northern,
southern and part of the eastern coast. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5.5. Temporal trends </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ERA5-Land and ERA5 properly reproduce the most important
spatial features of AEMET trend at annual scale (Fig. 10a). The three datasets
reproduce a decrease for the whole country in exception of the north- west and
south-east (and in a minor extent the Pyrenaic region) which experiment
positive trends. It is worth noting that differences exist in the exact
location, spatial extent and magnitude of these positive trend regions. At
seasonal scale, SON season shows the most discrepant behaviour between the datasets,
with ERA5-Land and ERA5 not properly reproducing the regions with negative
trend. For the rest of the seasons, a similar spatial reproduction is observed
with changes in absolute values of the trend. Comparison with the independent
verification (Fig. S12 and Fig. S13) did not reveal any remarkable difference
in the spatial distribution of the trend values. Statistically significant
trends (p- value &lt;0.05) where obtained mostly for AEMET dataset (Fig.
S14–16). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fig. 12. POD (a-e) and FAR (f-j) contribution for ERA5-Land.
Only the first, second and third categories with a higher number of misses and
false alarms are displayed (i.e., in Table S1 for each row we select for an
AEMET category the corresponding ERA5-Land categories with a higher number of
events and the same but column-wise). A category ideally classified would be
itself for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd category (i.e., misses and false alarms having
null values). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5.6. Error dependency with precipitation intensity and
orography </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Error analysis revealed continuous and categorical
statistics are intensity-category and region dependent. Spearman correlation
(Fig. 11a) shows a higher variability for the HP and VP categories. Same
spatial gradient as in Section 5.1 is observed. NP and MP generally provide the
best correlation (i.e., higher median value and less variability). RBIAS (Fig.
11b) displays overestimation for NP and LP while underestimation for MP, HP and
VP. Underestimation increases as it does the precipitation intensity. Generally,
NW and SW provide the best RBIAS performance (i.e., closer to null values).
RMSE (Fig. 11c) increases with precipitation category. Eastern regions provide
the highest RMSE values, especially SE in VP. KGE (Fig. 11.d) shows greater
variability for NP and VP. MP provides the best KGE performance. POD (FAR)
(Fig. 11e-f) decreases (increases) with precipitation category. There is a good
no-precipitation detection capacity, as indicated by the high and low POD and
FAR values, respectively. N region ranks the worst while eastern regions
provides an acceptable performance. Other categories provide an opposite
spatial behaviour (i.e., eastern regions ranking worst), especially for LP and
MP categories. A jump in performance is observed for MP category (i.e., better
performance than LP). VP and HP show a higher spatial variability than the
other categories. Same conclusions could be derived for ERA5 (Fig. S16). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fig. 12 assesses misclassifications between categories. Same
conclusions could be deduced for ERA5 (Fig. S17). Generally, misclassifications
tend to occur between neighbour categories (i.e., NP is wrongly assigned to LP
or MP but not VP). NP category is well classified. Most of AEMET events are
classified as NP by ERA5-Land, and the misses are assigned to the LP and MP
categories respectively (Fig. 12a). False detections additionally follow this
order (Fig. 12f). For LP category, ERA5-Land detects the most part of AEMET LP
events (Fig. 12b). Nevertheless, over the Mediterranean coast it falsely
classifies as LP AEMET NP events (Fig. 12g). Misclassifications in the MP
category are assigned to LP category followed by the NP and HP categories (Fig.
12c). Spatial heterogeneity in the misclassifications increase for HP and VP
(Fig. 12 d-e). In addition, HP and VP categories are not well represented
(i.e., the number of misses and false alarms are higher than the HP and VP
detected events). HP misclassifications are attributed to the MP category (Fig.
12d). LP representing the third contribution to ERA5-Land misses (Fig. 12d).
Focusing over areas of extreme events occurrence (Fig. 6a, AEMET VP), ERA5-Land
does not tend to falsely detect the VP events (Fig. 12j) nevertheless, an
important part of these is missed (Fig. 12e) (i.e., it properly classified a
small part of the events). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>KGE model performance (Fig. 13g-h) remains constant as a
function of orography. Weak spatial correlation in Table 4 supports this fact.
Nevertheless RBIAS (Fig. 13a-b), RMSE (Fig. 13c-d) reveal to be more dependent
on elevation and slope. Both statistics show an inflexion point at 1000 m (Fig.
13a,c). Spatial correlation (Table 4) does not indicate a strong relationship
between these two variables and the elevation. Slope behaviour is different.
RBIAS shows signs of underestimation (overestimation) for slope values &gt;20%
(&lt; 10%). 10–20% category provides the less deviated performance. RMSE shows
an increase with slope. Spatial correlation (Table 4) reveals a strong
relationship with slope, especially for RMSE. Kappa score (Fig. 13e-f) shows a
slight decrease with elevation and slope, which is supported by the weak
correlation in Table 4. Similar conclusions are derived for ERA5 (Fig. S18 and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6.1. Model performance </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6.1.1. Continuous-categorical-pdf assessment </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Continuous assessment of precipitation revealed a general
good agreement between AEMET observations and ERA5-Land/ERA5 estimates,
documented by KGE values &gt; 0.4 (behavioural), high correlation values
(0.5–0.9) and low values of RMSE (mostly between 2 and 8 mm/ d) (Fig. 2).
Categorical assessment also indicated a good agreement (kappa values between
0.4 and 0.8) (Fig. 3). Both assessments however revealed a dependence of the
performance with the spatial location. Correlation displayed a NW-SE spatial gradient,
which share some similarities with KGE and kappa spatial distribution,
especially over the Mediterranean coast and the Ebro River basin. Similar
spatial behaviour was reported by Belo-Pereira et al. (2011) over the Iberian
Peninsula (IP) when considering ERA-40 and ERA-Interim (i.e., ERA5/ERA5-Land
predecessor). This behaviour can be related to the climatic characteristics of
the study area: while in the N, NW and SW regions precipitation depends
particularly on synoptic-scale disturbances, in the NE and SE precipitation
shows a more complex variability (Cortesi et al., 2014). Over semiarid areas,
such as the eastern coast, precipitation is often a local phenomenon (Tapiador
et al., 2020). Especially, over these regions (NE and SE) deteriorated POD and FAR
statistics (Fig. 3) indicated that ERA5-Land/ERA5 reanalysis were
misclassifying AEMET dry days (i.e., no precipitation) as wet days (i.e.,
precipitation &gt;1 mm). This wet bias (dry days poor detection capacity) has
been also documented in IP by H´enin et al. (2018) and in other world regions
(el Kenawy et al., 2015; Beck et al., 2017; Amjad et al. (2020)). RBIAS (Fig.
2c) displayed signs of overestimation and underestimation. Overestimation has
been commonly reported for ERA5 (Crossett et al., 2020; Amjad et al., 2020;
Bandhauer et al., 2022). Nevertheless, underestimation has been also indicated
by Kolluru et al. (2020) and by Longo-Minnolo et al. (2022). A clearly uniform
RBIAS behaviour is difficult to observe for regions of high climatic complexity
(Beck et al., 2019; Sharifi et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2021). RMSE high values
spatially distributed across the northern and eastern coast might be partially
attributed to the closeness to the sea due to the more-complex breeze
circulation and coastal convection systems (Caracciolo et al., 2018; Lockhoff
et al., 2019). Nevertheless, AEMET associated uncertainty due to station
density is also a factor to consider, especially over the northern regions such
as Galicia. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Worst performance was observed in summer months for both the
continuous and categorical assessment. The shift in the median together with
the wider boxes and whiskers (Fig. 3 and Fig. 5) justified this fact. Summer is
dominated by unpredictable small-scale convective cells (Beck et al., 2019;
Tapiador et al., 2020). Representation of these convective precipitation is
still a limitation of the current reanalysis as reported by Ebert et al.
(2007), de Leeuw et al. (2015), Acharya et al. (2019), Xin et al. (2021)
amongst others. In relation with this fact, overestimation is generally
observed during these months, which has been also reported in Jiao et al.
(2021) and Longo-Minnolo et al. (2022). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The pdf assessment revealed that ERA5/ERA5-Land generally
reproduced the spatial location of precipitation frequency but disagrees in
terms of magnitude. It tends to underestimate the no-precipitation, heavy and
violent categories while overestimating light and moderate precipitation. This
finding agrees with studies that highlighted a general overestimation of
precipitation frequency in reanalysis (Beck et al., 2017; H´enin et al., 2018)
and an underestimation of heavy precipitation events (Crossett et al., 2020;
Jiang et al., 2021; Bli&#711;zn&#711;ak et al., 2022´ ). The eps-singleton test
highlighted the N, NE and SE regions as the most deviated from AEMET
probability distribution. These areas are of special difficulty for the
reanalysis because of the complex topography, the closeness to the coast and
the predominant role of convection in the precipitation formation, especially
for the eastern coast. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6.1.2. Spatial and temporal assessment </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ECMWF reanalysis was found to reproduce the pattern of daily
and monthly precipitation for the country (Fig. 9) being able to capture the
most part of the spatio-temporal variance. Similar good performance was
obtained from an EOF analysis in Jiao et al. (2021) for China. ECMWF first and
second EOFs mostly reproduce the AEMET EOFs spatial pattern, with discrepancies
occurring in the third EOF. Nevertheless, AEMET displays enhanced spatial
features in comparison to the reanalysis, especially over mountain regions (the
Central System, Sierra Morena mountains near the Guadalquivir depression). This
fact highlights the reanalysis difficulty in properly capturing the
spatio-temporal variance of areas with complex topography (Amjad et al., 2020;
Jiao et al., 2021). SPAEF values generally confirm the good representation of
the precipitation spatial patterns. Worse performance is observed at daily
scale (shift in the median and wider boxes and whiskers) mainly due to the
higher level of variability at this temporal scale. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Using reanalysis for temporal trend assessment remains
challenging due to the spurious variability that could be introduced in the
output signal because of the temporally fluctuating number of observations and
biases in assimilated observations and models (Bengtsson et al., 2004; Thorne
and Vose, 2010). However, reanalysis have been often used, especially when no
alternative source of data existed (Lindsay et al., 2014). Recent applications
of ECMWF precipitation trend analysis can be found in Chiaravalloti et al.
(2022) and Varlas et al. (2022). Gridded observations can be affected also by
the temporal variability of the network (Herrera et al., 2016). Despite the
possible associated uncertainties, the temporal trend assessment revealed that
ECMWF reanalysis generally reproduced AEMET annual and seasonal temporal trends
(Fig. 10). SON provided the most discrepant behaviour displaying an
overestimation of positive trend values. Discrepancies also existed in the
total extent of the spatial features observed (Fig. 10a). Reanalysis indicated
no significative precipitation trend (Fig. S14-S16). Although a strict
comparison with studies compiled from scientific literature is not
straightforward, mainly due to differences in the times series considered
(i.e., time period, number of stations, precise location and spatial
distribution of the stations, etc), the generalized dominant negative annual
trend is also documented in Ruiz Sinoga et al. (2011) for the region of
Andalusia, Del Río et al. (2005) for Castille and Leon region, and De Luis et
al. (2009) for the Mediterranean region. Río et al. (2011) documented
significant decreases in &gt; 28% of Spain in summer and winter. Positive
trends were reported in De Luis et al. (2009) and Fernandez-Montes and ´
Rodrigo (2015) for locations in the eastern and southern eastern coast at
annual scale and especially for the winter season. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6.1.3. Error dependency with precipitation-intensity and
topography </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The continuous and categorical analysis under different
precipitation intensities reported a deteriorated performance for the heavy and
violent categories (Fig. 11) (greater variability and deteriorated metric
values). For ERA5, Jiang et al. (2021) and Xin et al. (2021) documented a
similar RMSE increase and progressive change from overestimation to
underestimation with precipitation intensity over China. Moderate category
displayed the best KGE performance (Fig. 11d) and better precipitation event
discrimination than the rest of the categories (Fig. 11e-f), in exception of
NP. This is because of the dry days misclassification issue in LP and the
underestimation of HP and VP. For ERA5, better precipitation discrimination for
this category was also reported in Hafizi and Sorman (2022) and Kolluru et al.
(2020). Similar behaviour was obtained over Australia for ERA-Interim as
documented in Acharya et al. (2019). No precipitation category has a proper
detection but only assigns a small portion of the ground-truth no-precipitation
events. The events missed however increase the resulting overestimation (Fig.
11b) and deteriorated performance (Fig. 11d). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The error analysis with orography revealed that model
estimation and detection capability generally deteriorate in areas with more
complex topography (Fig. 11a-f). General significant correlation for the
different climatic regions supports this fact (Table 4). Orographic dependence
was also easily deductible in Fig. 2. Difficulties in the provision of
high-quality precipitation reanalysis estimates in mountainous terrain were
also reported in previous studies (Beck et al., 2019; Amjad et al., 2020; Chen
et al., 2021; Jiao et al., 2021; Longo-Minnolo et al., 2022). A clearer
relationship is obtained for the slope than elevation itself (Fig. 11a-f) (in
exception of the kappa statistic). In fact, the turning point in RMSE (Fig.
13c) can be attributed to the general flat conditions of the Meseta region
(between 600 and 800 m.a.s.l). Amjad et al. (2020) highlighted a deviation in
climatological totals with slope. Longo-Minnolo et al. (2022) reported
significant correlation between altitude variation within each ERA5-Land cell
and RMSE. This within-cell altitude variation can be easily linked with the
slope. KGE performance, contrary to the rest of the statistics, did not reveal
a strong correlation with elevation or slope. This is mainly due to the
disparity observed amongst the climatic regions considered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6.1.4. Differences between ERA5/ERA5-Land </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ERA5-Land and ERA5 performed very similar as it was expected
(ERA-5 Land is a rerun of ERA-5). Similar performance was reproduced for all
the analysis and only minor discrepancies were obtained for the absolute values
of the metrics (slightly higher temporal variability for ERA5-Land). Similar
findings were indicated by Xin et al. (2021), Chen et al. (2021) and
Bli&#711;zn&#711;ak et al. (2022)´ . Although the ERA5-Land higher spatial
resolution could be useful in regions with complex topography, no added
improvement is obtained regarding orographically induced precipitation (Zandler
et al., 2019; Hamm et al., 2020). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6.2. Future improvements </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This study has highlighted some weaknesses of the ECMWF
precipitation product. To be strictly fair, it should be stressed that the
approach considered suffers from a limitation present in many studies: the
uncertainty associated with the observations. Quality of the spatially
interpolated products is highly dependent on the network density, homogeneity,
quality control, interpolation algorithms, orographical conditions (Peral
García et al., 2017; Herrera et al., 2019). However, these limitations have been
considered, as far as possible, in the generation of the AEMET product (Peral
García et al., 2017). In addition, using high-resolution gridded datasets as
reference for product evaluation has also been undertaken in Beck et al.
(2019), Tapiador et al. (2020), Bandhauer et al. (2022) amongst others.
Grid-to-point analysis is also not free from associated uncertainties due to
scale mismatch and representativeness (Amjad et al., 2020). In any case, this
study can evaluate how well the test dataset satisfy a common user expectation
(i. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>e., what could be the discrepancies when using ECMWF's
reanalysis precipitation product instead of the reference Spanish
Meteorological Agency provided dataset). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Focusing on the study region, despite the extensive
assessment of the ECMWF precipitation performed in this study there are still
open questions to contribute: satellite performance vs. reanalysis performance
(partly introduced in Tapiador et al. (2020)), evaluation under a hydrological
framework (as in Senent-Aparicio et al., 2018), assessment of extremes (based
on H´enin et al. (2018)), assessment using new tools such as Triple Collocation
Analysis (TCA) (Li et al., 2018), sub-daily assessment, amongst others. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7. Conclusions </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This study provides a detailed evaluation of latest fifth
generation of ECMWF's precipitation products over Spain. The results obtained
here contribute to fill the knowledge gap refering to the performance of the
new ERA5-Land/ERA5 precipitation products over Spain and over the Mediterranean
region and thus contributing to the global evaluation of these products that is
being performed globally. The reanalysis precipitation evaluation was based on
a comparison with Spanish National Meteorological Agency long time series
(1951–2020) observed gridded product. The results obtained here are consistent
with finding with previous studies. The following main conclusions were drawn
from the study:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-           Continuous assessment revealed a general good
agreement between both observed and reanalysis datasets: spearman correlation
(0.5–0.9),RMSE (mostly between 2 and 8 mm/d) and KGE values &gt; 0.4. Worst
continuous performance was obtained in summer months, with a generalized
overestimation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-           Categorical assessment indicated a generalized
good precipitation detection (kappa values between 0.4 and 0.8) confirmed by
the chi- square statistics. A wet bias was revealed especially over the eastern
coast, as indicated by the decrease/increase in POD/FAR. Worst performance was
obtained during summer months. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-           PDF assessment indicated that ERA5-Land/ERA5
tended to overestimate light (&#8805;1 and &lt; 5 mm/day), and moderate
(&#8805;5 and &lt; 20 mm/day) precipitation categories while underestimating
the heavy (&#8805;20 and &lt; 40 mm/day) and violent (&#8805;40 mm/day)
categories. Mediterranean and northern coast were highlighted as the most pdf
discrepant, as shown by the Epps-Singleton test.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-           Spatial and temporal pattern assessment showed a
good agreement between the spatial patterns and temporal trends of the observed
and reanalysis datasets. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-           Error dependency on precipitation intensity and
orography highlighted moderate category had the best model performance.
Precipitation estimation and detection were found to be dependent on orography.
Positive correlations were obtained for RBIAS (0.41/ 0.35, for ERA5-Land/ERA5)
and RMSE (0.69/0.70) while negative correlation was found for Kappa (&#8722;
0.29/&#8722; 0.34).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-           No significant differences were deduced between
the ERA5-Land and ERA5 results as indicated by the different analysis
performed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Conclusions provided by this study could be useful for
hydrological and meteorological applications that make use of these
precipitation datasets over the region. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abstract. Framed within the Copernicus Climate Change
Service (C3S) of the European Commission, the European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is producing an enhanced global dataset for the land
component of the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5), hereafter
referred to as ERA5-Land. Once completed, the period covered will span from
1950 to the present, with continuous updates to support land monitoring
applications. ERA5-Land describes the evolution of the water and energy cycles
over land in a consistent manner over the production period, which, among
others, could be used to analyse trends and anomalies. This is achieved through
global high-resolution numerical integrations of the ECMWF land surface model
driven by the downscaled meteorological forcing from the ERA5 climate
reanalysis, including an elevation correction for the thermodynamic
near-surface state. ERA5-Land shares with ERA5 most of the parameterizations
that guarantees the use of the state-of-the-art land surface modelling applied
to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. A main advantage of ERA5-Land
compared to ERA5 and the older ERA-Interim is the horizontal resolution, which
is enhanced globally to 9km compared to 31km (ERA5) or 80km (ERA-Interim),
whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in ERA5. Evaluation against
independent in situ observations and global model or satellite-based reference
datasets shows the added value of ERA5-Land in the description of the
hydrological cycle, in particular with enhanced soil moisture and lake
description, and an overall better agreement of river discharge estimations
with available observations. However, ERA5-Land snow depth fields present a
mixed performance when compared to those of ERA5, depending on geographical
location and altitude. The description of the energy cycle shows comparable
results with ERA5. Nevertheless, ERA5-Land reduces the global averaged root
mean square error of the skin temperature, taking as reference MODIS data,
mainly due to the contribution of coastal points where spatial resolution is
important. Since January 2020, the ERA5-Land period available has extended from
January 1981 to the near present, with a 2- to 3-month delay with respect to
real time. The segment prior to 1981 is in production, aiming for a release of
the whole dataset in summer/autumn 2021. The high spatial and temporal
resolution of ERA5-Land, its extended period, and the consistency of the fields
produced makes it a valuable dataset to support hydrological studies, to initialize
NWP and climate models, and to support diverse applications dealing with water
resource, land, and environmental management.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1          Introduction</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The land surface state plays a crucial role in the coupled
Earth system, especially on seasonal to interseasonal predictability and
climate projections (Koster et al., 2004). The development of land surface
models has greatly benefited from offline simulations to isolate the role of
different land surface processes and to increase the performance of
hydrological and thermodynamic variables. Land surface models were initially
used in offline mode for model development with early intercomparison studies driven
by either in situ observations (Henderson-Sellers et al., 1995; Etchevers et
al., 2004) or global reanalysis datasets (Dirmeyer et al., 1999). More
recently, multi-model intercomparison studies and datasets focusing on water
resources monitoring (Harding et al., 2011; Schellekens et al., 2017) or
climate modelling (van den Hurk et al., 2016; Krinner et al., 2018) have gained
significant visibility. Offline simulations remain attractive due to their
computational affordability and the needs that follow from the rapid evolution
of land surface models (Pitman, 2003; Vereecken et al., 2019; Boussetta et al.,
2021).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A key advantage of using offline land surface estimates is
their temporal consistency, unlike in the case of coupled land–atmosphere
predictions (e.g. operational weather forecasts) that experience frequent
updates. Atmospheric reanalyses also provide such a consistency. However,
atmospheric reanalysis can be affected by systematic biases, in particular in
precipitation, which has led to the development of bias correction
methodologies (Weedon et al., 2011; Reichle et al., 2017). Land data
assimilation systems (LDASs) also provide an important component of reanalyses,
which can mitigate model errors and enhance the representation of the land
surface state in regions and periods with available observations (Albergel et
al., 2017). However, this can also result in temporal and spatial
inconsistencies (e.g. due to changing observations’ availability) as well as
limitations in the closure of the surface water budget (Zsoter et al., 2019).
Examples of existing global offline datasets are the Global Offline Land-surface
Data-set (GOLD) (Dirmeyer and Tan, 2001), MERRA-Land (Reichle et al., 2011),
and ERA-Interim/Land (Balsamo et al., 2015). The latter was motivated by
important updates to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
(ECMWF) land surface scheme introduced in the operational forecasting model in
2006, when the production of ERA-Interim started. These changes embedded in
ERAInterim/Land provided seasonal forecasting with more accurate and consistent
land initial conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Compared to atmospheric reanalysis, offline land surface
reanalyses can be produced faster and at more affordable computational cost. An
arguable disadvantage compared to high-resolution Earth observation data is the
lack of smallscale heterogeneity found in offline model-only based estimates.
However, observational datasets suffer from temporal and spatial gaps, and only
a few land variables are directly “observable”, so complex algorithms that
blend observations and model output are needed to retrieve a complete estimate
of land variables. Furthermore, advances in land surface modelling and the
increase of computational resources now make it feasible to run offline models
at finer resolutions than traditionally possible. Therefore, offline global
simulations are a valuable way to ensure continuity and completeness of the
land surface fields, which are two important aspects to foster research at
continental scales in climate studies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although the development of offline model estimates has been
motivated mainly by climate and weather research, new user requirements are
constantly emerging in society. The effects of climate change are pushing
different economic sectors to implement novel adaptation strategies to adjust
to the new reality. For example, crop production is already being affected by
increasing temperatures and decreased water availability (Lobell et al., 2011;
Wheeler and von Braun, 2013; Zhao et al., 2017). This may induce changes to
traditional watering crop strategies, harvesting periods, pest management, or
even crop culture replacements. Likewise, insurance (and reinsurance) companies
need reliable historical data to assess the risk of severe droughts or flooding
(Tadesse et al., 2015; Jensen and Barrett, 2016), in particular for smallholder
agriculture. For public and private stakeholders, offline land surface datasets
can provide complementary information needed to support decision makers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This paper documents the new land component of the fifth
generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5), hereafter referred to as the
ERA5-Land dataset (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019a). Unlike ERA-Interim/Land, which was
produced as a oneoff single-simulation research dataset covering the period of
1979–2010, ERA5-Land is now an integral and operational component of the
Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). This means, among others, that the
production is guaranteed with timely updates and synchronized with ERA5 monthly
updates. To investigate the added value of ERA5-Land, the latter was compared
to two other operational reanalysis products: ERA5 and ERA-Interim (operational
until 31 August 2019). This comparison also makes it possible to study the
evolution of ECMWF operational reanalyses. ERA-Interim/Land was not included in
the comparison as it was only available until 2010, and it was intended to be a
research dataset. As a reference for the evaluation, in situ observations from
different networks around the globe have been used for comparison to the
reanalyses estimates. In addition, complementary global gridded model- or
satellite-based datasets have been incorporated into the evaluation exercise.
Improvements in ERA5 compared to ERAInterim are mainly due to 10 years of
additional research and development (R&amp;D) in the use of satellite data in
numerical weather prediction (NWP) and atmospheric modelling (Hersbach et al.,
2020). Differences between ERA5 and ERA5-Land are not so obvious. They both
share quite similar parameterizations of land processes; the main improvement
of ERA5-Land is due to the non-linear dynamical downscaling with corrected
thermodynamic input.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Section 2 describes the main steps of the methodology used
to produce ERA5-Land; in Sect. 3, the data used to investigate the added value
of ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 and ERA-Interim (mainly from the years 2000–2018)
are described. Section 4 shows the results of the evaluation exercise, while
information on access to the data is presented in Sect. 5. A discussion of the
results and the conclusions is presented in Sect. 6, followed by perspectives
for future updates in Sect. 7</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2          Methodology</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ERA5-Land produces a total of 50 variables describing the
water and energy cycles over land, globally, hourly, and at a spatial
resolution of 9km, matching the ECMWF triangular– cubic–octahedral (TCo1279)
operational grid (Malardel et al., 2016). For a full list of the available
fields in the ERA5Land catalogue, see Table A2 in Appendix A. The production is
conducted in three segments or streams. The reason is twofold: (1) it allows
the production of parallel streams, therefore accelerating the production and
the public availability of the data; (2) the atmospheric forcing necessary to
produce ERA5-Land is derived from ERA5, and thus the production needs the
corresponding segment of ERA5 completed for the same time period. Figure 1
shows the different data streams designed in the production of ERA5-Land. The
production started with data from the year 2001 (stream-1) aiming at making
available firstly the most recent data, while the back extension from 1950 to
1980 (stream-3) is currently under production.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each segment or stream is initialized with meteorological
fields from ERA5. ERA5-Land does not assimilate observations directly. The
observations influence the land surface evolution via the atmospheric forcing.
Forcing air temperature, humidity, and pressure are corrected using a daily
lapse rate derived from ERA5. After that, the land surface model is integrated
in 24h cycles providing the evolution of the land surface state and associated
water and energy fluxes. In addition to the hourly data, monthly means are also
computed (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019b). Figure 2 shows a diagram of the algorithm used
for each 24h production cycle. The most important components of the production
algorithm are presented in the following subsections.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.1       Initialization</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ERA5-Land is not produced as a single continuous simulation
for the entire period. The production is conducted in three independent
streams, as shown in Fig. 1. To avoid or minimize discontinuities between
streams, a careful initialization procedure is needed for each of them.
Particular attention must be given to variables carrying long memory. As an
example, Fig. 3 shows time series of deep soil moisture in a band of latitude
between 60 and 20&#9702; S, where the averaged annual soil moisture variability
is low. This period includes several production streams of ERA5. ERA5
initialized each stream with ERA-Interim soil moisture initial conditions,
which has a different climatology than ERA5. In ERA5, a 1-year spin-up was used
for each production stream and it is normally long enough for atmospheric
variables. However, it is not sufficient for deep soil moisture to reach
equilibrium, which leads to discontinuities between two production streams, as
shown in Fig. 3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The strategy followed to initialize the ERA5-Land production
stream starting in 2001 (stream-1) was to use the latest year of a long, prior
ERA5 stream, and letting 3 further spinup years to allow a long spin-up period
(see Fig. 1). While this strategy provides satisfactory results for most
continental masses around the world, discontinuities are still possible at
areas with very low variability of soil moisture (deserts and polar regions).
Particular attention was given to the treatment of permanent snow-covered
regions. The current model formulation (as in ERA5) does not have an
independent treatment of glaciers. Grid points with glaciers are assigned with
a constant snow mass of 10m. ERA5-Land streams are initialized on the 1
January, and a glacier mask is applied to snow mass to guarantee the correct
spatial representation of glaciers. A threshold of 50% of a grid box covered by
ice is used, below which the snow depth keeps the value computed by the snow
scheme of the land model. Values above the threshold assign a snow water
equivalent value of 10m. This condition is used to avoid grid points near
glaciers with large unrealistic snow depth that result from the interpolation
from ERA5 fields to ERA5-Land. For the stream starting in 1981 (stream-2), a
long, prior ERA5 stream was not available. The strategy in this case was to
initialize using a ERA5-Land climatology of 1 January for the period 2001– 2018
and then allow the system to spin up for 3 years. A similar strategy was used
to initialize the stream starting in 1950 (stream-3), but in this case a
1981–2010 climatology was used and only 1 spin-up year was feasible. The latter
was limited by the availability of forcing data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forecast meteorological forcing fields from ERA5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.2       Static and climatological fields</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As in ERA5, the land characteristics are described using
several time-invariant fields. These consist of the land–sea mask, the lake
cover and depth, the soil and vegetation type, and the vegetation cover. In
addition, surface albedo and leaf area index are prescribed as monthly
climatologies. The complete list of time invariant fields with their
information source is provided in Table A1 of Appendix A.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.3       Atmospheric forcing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ERA5-Land is driven by atmospheric forcing derived from ERA5
near-surface meteorology state and flux fields. The meteorological state fields
are obtained from the lowest ERA5 model level (level 137), which is 10m above
the surface, and include air temperature, specific humidity, wind speed, and
surface pressure. The surface fluxes include downward shortwave and longwave
radiation and liquid and solid total precipitation. These fields are
interpolated from the ERA5 resolution of about 31km to ERA5-Land resolution of
about 9km via a linear interpolation method based on</p>

Hydrology-Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land (CHTESSEL) land

<p class=MsoNormal>curve) and ERA5-Land (dark curve).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a triangular mesh. The atmospheric forcing built for
ERA5Land is hourly and consistent over the entire production period, and it is
the result of the assimilation of a large number of conventional meteorological
and satellite observations through a four-dimensional variational assimilation
system (4D-Var) and simplified extended Kalman filter (SEKF) systems as
described in Hersbach et al. (2020). Previous land reanalyses have included
corrections to the precipitation forcing to address limitations of the precipitation
fields of the atmospheric reanalysis. This is not the case in ERA5-Land mainly
due to the (1) enhanced quality of ERA5 precipitation when compared with
previous atmospheric reanalyses (e.g. Beck et al., 2019; Tarek et al., 2020;
Nogueira, 2020) and (2) reduced dependencies on external data that would limit
the near-real-time data availability. However, air temperature, humidity, and
pressure are corrected for the altitude differences between ERA5 and ERA5-Land
grids. This correction involves four steps: (i) relative humidity is computed
from interpolated, uncorrected fields; (ii) air temperature is adjusted for the
altitude differences using a daily environmental lapse rate (ELR) field derived
from ERA5 lower troposphere temperature vertical profiles (Dutra et al., 2020);
(iii) surface pressure is corrected for the altitude differences and correction
of temperature; and (iv) specific humidity is computed using the corrected
temperature and pressure assuming that there is no change in relative humidity.
Dutra et al. (2020) present a detailed evaluation of this methodology comparing
the use of a constant (time and space) ELR with daily ELR fields derived from
ERA5. This methodology was shown to reduce the mean absolute error (MAE) of
daily maximum temperature by 10% and by 4% for daily minimum temperature with
respect to ERA5 when compared with 2941 stations over the western US. The
importance of the ELR correction is shown in the orography map of the Alpine
region around Switzerland in Fig. 4. ERA5 misses many of the highest Alpine
peaks due to the coarser resolution. Taking into account these orographic
differences is important for other land variables such as surface temperature.
For instance, the middle and bottom rows show a more realistic spatial pattern
of surface temperature in ERA5-Land, with a clear cold signal over the higher
peaks. It is also remarkable to see how ERA5-Land is able to resolve lakes such
as Geneva (Léman), Neuchâtel, and Constance. This is especially visible at
06:00UTC, when the lake surface temperature is still significantly warmer than
the land (Fig. 4f).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.4       Land surface model</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The core of ERA5-Land is the ECMWF land surface model: the
Carbon Hydrology-Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land (CHTESSEL).
The main updates with respect to the land component of ERA-Interim are (a) a
revised soil hydrology, introducing an improved formulation of the soil
hydrologic conductivity and diffusivity (that now is variable as a function of
soil texture) and surface runoff based on variable infiltration capacity
(Balsamo et al., 2010); (b) a fully revised parametrization of the snow scheme,
changing the hydrological and radiative properties of the snowpack (Dutra et
al., 2010); (c) the introduction of a climatological seasonality of vegetation,
in contrast to the fixed vegetation in ERA-Interim (Boussetta et al., 2013b);
(d) a new scheme for bare soil evaporation, allowing soil moisture to reach
values below the wilting point (Albergel et al., 2012); (e) introduction of a
lake model to represent the thermodynamics of inland water bodies (Balsamo et
al., 2012); and (f) a parametrization that allows the estimation of land carbon
fluxes – net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP), and
ecosystem respiration (Reco) – in a modular way with the Jarvis approach that
computes the stomatal conductance without affecting the transpiration
components (Boussetta et al., 2013a).</p>

Geneva (Léman), Neuchâtel, and Constance are indicated in panel (b).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The land surface model version used in ERA5-Land was
operational at ECMWF in 2018 with the model cycle Cy45r1. A detailed
description of the model can be found in chapter IV of the Integrated
Forecasting System (IFS) documentation (https://www.ecmwf.int/node/18714, last
access: December 2020). Compared with the model version of ERA5, the
differences are mostly technical, with the exception of (i) an updated
parametrization of the soil thermal conductivity following Peters-Lidard et al.
(1998) that takes into account the ice component in the case of frozen soil,
(ii) a fix to improve conservation for the soil water balance, and (iii) rain
over snow is accounted for and it does not accumulate in the snowpack.
Potential evapotranspiration (PET) flux in ERA5 suffers from a bug present in
IFS cycle 41r2 that affects PET computation over forests and deserts. This
problem has been corrected in ERA5-Land, and unlike in ERA5, ERA5-Land includes
PET in the portfolio of products. Given the importance of this variable for
some applications, it is worth clarifying that PET is computed by making a
second call to the surface energy balance assuming a vegetation type of crops
and no soil moisture stress. In other words, evaporation is computed for
agricultural land as if it is well watered and assuming that the atmosphere is
not affected by this artificial surface condition. The latter may not always be
realistic. Therefore, despite the fact that PET is meant to provide an estimate
of irrigation requirements, one has to be cautious especially for arid
conditions, since the method can give unrealistic results due to too-strong
evaporation forced by dry air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3          Data and evaluation strategy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To evaluate the quality of the ERA5-Land fields, several key
variables of the water and energy cycles were selected and compared to
available in situ observations and to a series of reference datasets. Note that
the list of evaluated variables and reference datasets is not exhaustive and
was based on factors such as availability of data at the time of the
evaluation. ERA-Interim and ERA5 reanalyses were included in the comparison,
aiming at showcasing the progress of operational reanalyses at ECMWF. The variables
evaluated are soil moisture, snow depth, lake surface water temperature and
river discharge for the water cycle, the sensible and latent heat fluxes (the
latter also a component of the water cycle), the Bowen ratio, and skin
temperature for the energy cycle. This section describes the supporting
datasets used in the evaluation exercise and the metrics employed to assess the
quality of ERA5-Land fields.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.1       ERA-Interim</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ERA-Interim (Dee et al., 2011) is the former ECMWF
reanalysis providing estimates for the atmosphere, ocean waves, and land
surface. It had supported scientific progress during the previous decade and is
still widely used today by the scientific community. It includes information on
multiple land and atmospheric variables, and it is available from January 1979
to August 2019. It used the IFS version Cy31r2 (more detailed information
available at https: //www.ecmwf.int/en/publications/ifs-documentation, last
access: 27 August 2021), corresponding to the IFS 2006 release, with a spatial
horizontal resolution of about 80km and 60 levels in the vertical from the
surface to 0.1hPa. The system includes a 4D-Var system (Rabier et al., 2000)
providing analyses fields at a temporal resolution of 6 and 3h for
shortforecast fields (like for precipitation and fluxes). The main difference
between the land component of ERA-Interim and those of both ERA5 and ERA5-Land
is that the former is based on TESSEL (van den Hurk et al., 2000), which is
considered the precursor of the current CHTESSEL scheme. In ERA-Interim, the
soil moisture and soil temperature analyses are based on a local optimal
interpolation scheme (Mahfouf, 1991; Douville et al., 2000) that assimilates
surface synoptic (SYNOP) observations of temperature and relative humidity at
screen level (2m). The snow depth analysis is independent of the soil wetness
and is based on a Cressman analysis that assimilates SYNOP snow reports and
snow-free satellite observations (Drusch et al., 2004).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.2       ERA5</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ERA5 is the latest comprehensive ECMWF reanalysis and has
replaced ERA-Interim. It is based on a version of the ECMWF IFS (Cy41r2) that
was operational in 2016. ERA5 provides hourly estimates of the global
atmosphere, land surface, and ocean waves from 1950 and is updated daily with a
latency of 5d. Its state estimates are based on a highresolution (HRES)
component at a horizontal resolution of 31km and with 137 levels in the
vertical spanning from the surface up to 0.01hPa. Information on uncertainties
in these are provided by a 10-member ensemble of data assimilations (EDA) at
half the horizontal resolution. Both the HRES and EDA ERA5 data assimilation
use background-error estimates that utilize the output from the EDA. The land
component of ERA5 is, like ERA5-Land, based on the CHTESSEL model, though at a
resolution of 31km rather than 9km. ERA5 uses new analyses of sea-surface
temperature and seaice concentration, variations in radiative forcing derived
from CMIP5 specifications, and various new and reprocessed observational data
records.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The data assimilation system consists of an incremental
4D-Var component (Courtier et al., 1994) for upper-air and near-surface
components, an ocean-wave optimal interpolation scheme, and a dedicated LDAS.
The LDAS comprises a two-dimensional optimal interpolation scheme for the
analysis of screen-level 2m temperature and relative humidity, and for snow
(depth and density), a point-wise simplified extended Kalman filter (de Rosnay
et al., 2013) for three soil moisture layers in the top 1m of soil, and a one-dimensional
optimal interpolation for soil, ice, and snow temperature. Details of the ERA5
configuration are given in Hersbach et al. (2020), which also contains a basic
evaluation of characteristics and performance for the segment from 1979 onward.
The performance of the component from 1950 to 1978, the back extension which
was made available later, is described in Bell et al. (2021), and a detailed
analysis for surface temperature and humidity is provided by Simmons et al.
(2021). Technical details are also provided in the online documentation
(https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ ERA5:+data+documentation, last
access: 23 August 2021).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both ERA5 and ERA5-Land are produced as part of the
Copernicus Climate Change Service that ECMWF operates on behalf of the European
Commission and are available from the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS). ERA5 and
ERA5Land have a large and diverse user base (more than 40000 users at the end
of 2020). Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of ERA-Interim, ERA5, and
ERA5-Land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.3       Soil moisture</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To evaluate the quality of the soil moisture estimates from
the various reanalyses, a large number (&gt; 800) of in situ sensors in the
period 2010 to 2018, many providing hourly measurements, were used. These
sensors belong to the networks that are listed in Table 2. The networks are
located in North America, Europe, Africa, and Australia, and all the
observations were retrieved from the International Soil Moisture Network
(Dorigo et al., 2011, 2021). Three reanalysis soil layer estimates were
compared to measurements by sensors at three different depths. ERA5 and
ERA5-Land top layer soil moisture estimates (0–7cm) were compared to in situ
sensors at 5cm depth in North America, Africa, Europe, and Australia. A more
in-depth study was performed in North America, where most of the sensors are
located. For this region, surface soil moisture from ERA-Interim was also
evaluated. In addition, ERA5, ERA5-Land, and ERAInterim soil moisture for the
second (7–28cm) and third layers (28–100cm) were evaluated against in situ
measurements at 20 and 50cm depth, respectively. In situ measurements were
compared to the closest grid point of the ERA5, ERA5Land, and ERA-Interim grids
if the closest grid point was not farther than the respective model resolution.
In situ time samples were selected in a ±1h window with respect to the
reanalysis timestamp. If several observations were retrieved in a single
window, the average was computed. In order to consider an observed time series
suited for the comparison, a minimum of 150 samples was required for the study
period. To remove the seasonal cycle, anomaly time series were also computed.

(STDD, equivalent to the unbiased RMSD), the bias, and the Pearson correlation
coefficient (R).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The latter was also computed for the anomaly time series
(RAN). The results were grouped per continent and their distribution presented
in box plots. Values are considered outliers if they are greater than q75
+1.5×(q75 &#8722;q25) or less than q25 &#8722;1.5×(q75 &#8722;q25), with q25
and q75 the 25th and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>75th percentiles, respectively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.4       Snow</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Snow depth estimates from reanalyses were compared to two
sets of observational data. The first one comprises 10 sites distributed among
North America, Europe, and Japan. They were selected as reference sites to
evaluate cold processes by models participating in the Earth System Model –
Snow Model Intercomparison Project (ESM-SnowMIP) (Krinner et al., 2018; Ménard
et al., 2019). These sites provide benchmarking data for cold processes in
maritime, Alpine, and taiga types of snow cover and on different types of
climates. Table 3 presents these stations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second dataset is retrieved from the Global Historical
Climatology Network-Daily (GHCN-daily) (Menne et al., 2012b) from 1 July 2010
to 30 June 2018. The version used is v3.24 (Menne et al., 2012a). This network
integrates thousands of land surface stations across the globe. The daily
observed snow depth product was compared to the daily averaged snow depth
estimates from ERA-Interim, ERA5, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ERA5-Land at 00:00 and 12:00UTC. To compare the reanalysis
data with the snow depth observations, the prognostic snow water equivalent
(SWE, in units of m water equivalent) and snow density (&#961;snow,
kgm&#8722;3) from the reanalysis were combined to compute the actual snow depth
(SD, m):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>SWE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>SD = &#961;water     ,          (2)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#961;snow</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>where &#961;water = 1000kgm&#8722;3 is the reference density
of the water. The GHCN observations were only considered if snow depth values
were positive and missing values were lower than 50% of the recorded time
series. Also stations where the snow depth reported is lower than 1cm in more
than 5% of the total number of days were removed. Finally, stations located in
coastal areas with more than 50% water in the pixel and on permanent snow area
(glaciers) were removed. More than 6000 stations passed the quality filters,
and their locations can be found in Fig. 9. The quality of the snow depth from
the reanalyses was evaluated at the hemispheric scale by computing the mean
bias (here defined as reanalysis estimate minus in situ observation) and root
mean square error (RMSE) for the months between December and June of the
2010–2018 period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.5       Lakes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 2015, the CHTESSEL land surface scheme of the operational
IFS introduced a lake tile, which represents lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and
coastal (subgrid) waters, and is based on the FLake (Fresh-water Lake) model of
Mironov et al. (2010a). FLake is a one-dimensional model, which uses an assumed
shape for the lake temperature profile including the mixed layer (uniform
distribution of temperature) and the thermocline (its upper boundary located at
the mixed-layer</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>bottom, and the lower boundary at the lake bottom). To run
FLake, the lake location (or fractional cover), lake depth (most important
parameter, preferably bathymetry), and lake initial conditions are required.
For the best performance, lake depth should be updated with the latest
available information to ensure that depths are close to observed values, as
overestimated depths can be blamed for cold biases in summer temperatures or
lack of ice. The state of lakes in FLake is described by seven prognostic variables:
mixed-layer temperature, mixed-layer depth, bottom temperature, mean
temperature of the water column, shape factor (with respect to the temperature
profile in the thermocline), temperature at the ice upper surface, and ice
thickness. In this paper, the lake surface water temperature (LSWT) estimates
from the FLake model embedded in ERA5 and ERA5-Land were compared to in situ
observations from three different sources of data, during ice-free periods:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>–          The Alqueva reservoir in Portugal, from the
Portuguese</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>University of Évora, provided hourly data from 2017</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and 2018. In addition, daily averaged values were also
computed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>–          In total, 27 Finnish lakes monitored by Finnish
Environment Institute (SYKE) provided daily data (one measurement per day at
08:00LT) from 2000 to 2016. In addition, summer month (June, July, and August)
average values were calculated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>–          Summer month average values were provided from
the global inventory “Globally distributed LSWT collected in situ and by
satellites; 1985–2009”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?
packageid=knb-lter-ntl.10001.3, last access: 29 August 2021). In total, there
were 348 lakes over the globe with in situ data for 15 years (1995–2009).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 5 provides the location of all the sources of in situ
data used in this study. Considering the above observations as the truth, the
MAE of ERA5 and ERA5-Land LSWT estimates was computed. The significance of
these results was tested using the Kruskal–Wallis test by ranks. In addition,
the bias distribution was also calculated and presented in 2D bar graphs. It
should be noted that the Alqueva reservoir and the 27 Finnish lake depths were
verified (in situ vs. operational values) and are in good agreement; the lake
depths provided by the “Globally distributed LSWT collected in situ and by
satellites; 1985–2009” global inventory were only randomly verified (e.g. by
comparison with scientific publications), which might add some uncertainty when
interpreting the results.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.6       River discharge</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The current version of CHTESSEL does not directly produce
river discharge at the river basin scale. Instead, gridded surface and
subsurface runoff from CHTESSEL is coupled to the LISFLOOD hydrological and
channel routing model (Van Der Knijff et al., 2010). Coupling ERA5/ERA5Land
runoff with LISFLOOD allows for lateral connectivity of grid cells with runoff
routed through the river channel to produce river discharge (m3 s&#8722;1).
This is the process used within the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS;
https://www.globalfloods.eu/, last access: 29 August 2021). More details can be
found in Harrigan et al. (2020). River discharge estimates from ERA5
(GloFAS-ERA5) and ERA5Land (GloFAS-ERA5-Land) were obtained for the period
January 2001 to December 2018. This is the common period for which reanalysis
data were available at the time of this study. Estimates were resampled to the
GloFAS 0.1&#9702; gridded river network at a daily time step. As part of
GloFAS, a database of global hydrological observations for 2042 stations is
held, consisting predominantly (i.e. <span style='font-family:"Cambria Math",serif'>&#8764;</span>75%)
of the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) and supplemented by data collected
through collaboration with GloFAS partners worldwide to improve spatial
coverage. The locations of the stations have been matched to the corresponding
cells on the 0.1&#9702; GloFAS river network. Following Harrigan et al. (2020),
a number of criteria were used to select stations for the evaluation:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>–          at least 4 years of data available between 2001
and 2018</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(not necessarily contiguous),</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>–          minimum upstream area of 500km2,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>–          difference in catchment area supplied by the data
provider and upstream area for the corresponding cell on the GloFAS river
network must be within 20%, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>–          station with the longest record retained when
multiple observation stations were matched to the same GloFAS river cell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition to the above conditions, a first-order visual
quality check on observed river discharge time series removed stations with
erroneous data (for example, time series truncated above a threshold, showing
several inhomogeneities or series monitoring an artificial canal instead of a
river). This filtering procedure resulted in the selection of 1285 stations
with drainage areas ranging between 575 and 4664200km2, and a median of
29963km2. Following the methodology of Harrigan et al. (2020), hydrological
performance was assessed using the modified Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE0)
metric (Gupta et al., 2009; Kling et al., 2012). The KGE0 is an overall summary
measure consisting of three components important for assessing hydrological
dynamics: temporal errors through correlation, bias errors, and variability
errors:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> q</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>KGE0 = 1&#8722; (R &#8722;1)2 &#8722;(&#946; &#8722;1)2
&#8722;(&#947; &#8722;1)2          (3)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            µs        &#963;s/µs</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#946; =   &#947; =  , µo &#963;o/µo    (4)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>where R is the Pearson correlation coefficient between
reanalysis simulations (s) and observations (o), &#946; is the bias ratio,
&#947; is the variability ratio, µ the mean discharge, and &#963; the discharge
standard deviation. The KGE0 and its three decomposed components (correlation,
bias ratio, and variability ratio) are all dimensionless, with an optimum value
of 1. To evaluate the hydrological skill of GloFAS-ERA5-Land, the KGE0 can be
computed as a skill score, KGESS, with GloFAS-ERA5 used as the benchmark:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>KGE0GloFAS&#8722;ERA5-Land &#8722;KGE0GloFAS&#8722;ERA5</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>KGESS =         0         0          ,           (5)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>KGEperf &#8722;KGEGloFAS&#8722;ERA5</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>where KGE0GloFAS&#8722;ERA5-Land is the KGE0 value for the
GloFAS-ERA5-Land reanalysis against observations, KGE0GloFAS&#8722;ERA5 is the
KGE0 value for the GloFAS-ERA5 benchmark against observations, and KGE0perf is
the value of KGE0 for a perfect simulation, which is 1. KGESS = 0 means the
GloFAS-ERA5-Land reanalysis is no better than the GloFAS-ERA5 benchmark and
thus has no skill, KGESS &gt; 0 indicates when GloFAS-ERA5-Land is considered
skilful, and KGESS &lt; 0 is when the performance is worse than the GloFAS-ERA5
benchmark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.7       Energy fluxes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.7.1    FLUXNET data</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The evaluation of the ERA5-Land turbulent fluxes estimates
was conducted mostly following the method of Martens et al. (2020). Surface
sensible and latent heat fluxes (also denoted in this paper as H and
&#955;&#961;E, respectively) derived from ERA reanalyses, as well as their
ratio (i.e. the Bowen ratio, hereafter denoted as &#946;), were compared to
measurements from the FLUXNET 2015 synthesis dataset (Pastorello et al., 2020).
The period under evaluation was based on the availability of reanalysis data at
the time of the comparison, and therefore, unlike in Martens et al. (2020), the
evaluation period is constrained to 2001–2014. Following Martens et al. (2017),
the in situ flux data were subjected to quality control, including (1) the
removal of rainy intervals, during which eddy-covariance measurements are
typically unreliable, and (2) the removal of gap-filled records to retain only
the actual measurements from the eddy-covariance sites. After quality control,
only sites with a minimum record of 5 years were retained too. In total, 65
eddy-covariance sites remained after quality control and were used as in situ
reference data. Note that the measured energy fluxes used as reference in this
paper were not corrected for energy balance closure because the number of towers
used for validation would be drastically reduced, as the ground-heat flux is
also needed and is not available from many towers. Some authors have already
highlighted the lack of closure in the energy balance at eddy-covariance sites
and a consequential tendency to underestimate the latent heat flux (Wilson et
al., 2002; Ershadi et al., 2014; Jiménez et al., 2018). The reference sites are
mainly distributed across the continental US, Europe, and Australia (see their
locations in Fig. 17a, b, and c, respectively). For each eddy-covariance site,
the in situ measurements were aggregated from their native temporal resolution
to hourly, 3-hourly, and daily intervals. In addition, standardized anomalies
were calculated by subtracting for each time interval the climatological
expectation (i.e. the average value across the entire record for that interval)
and dividing by the standard deviation of that climatology. While the
comparison to raw time series may mask the influence of short-term
meteorological anomalies on surface energy partitioning (as the temporal
variability of turbulent fluxes typically depends strongly on the seasonality
of its main drivers), the comparison to anomaly time series reflects the
response to short-term meteorological conditions. The Bowen ratio was only
calculated at daily temporal resolution for numerical instability reasons. As
described in Martens et al. (2020), outliers in the time series of the Bowen
ratio, for both the reanalyses and in situ data, were masked using a
quantile-based approach. The bias, i.e. the difference between raw in situ time
series and reanalysis estimates, the standardized MAE, and the anomaly Pearson
correlation coefficient (RAN) were computed. The results are shown in the form
of violin plots in Sect. 4.5.1.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.7.2    GLEAM</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM; Miralles
et al., 2011; Martens et al., 2017) is used in this study with two objectives:
(a) to compare the GLEAM evaporation estimates directly to the ERA5 and
ERA5-Land estimates, which in turn will assess the skill of the underlying land
surface model to simulate turbulent heat fluxes, and (b) as an intermediate
tool to assess the quality differences of key input meteorological drivers of
the turbulent fluxes computed by GLEAM. GLEAM is a process-based, yet
semiempirical, model that computes total evaporation and its separate
components over continental masses at global scale. A detailed description of
this model can be found in Martens et al. (2017) and Miralles et al. (2010,
2011). In this paper, version 3 (v3) of the GLEAM algorithm is used and forced
with the same database as in the official v3.4a dataset (see
https://www.gleam.eu, last access: 29 August 2021), including near-surface air
temperature and surface net radiation from ERA5; this dataset is hereafter
referred to as GLEAM+ERA5. Likewise, a version of GLEAM run with ERA5-Land air
temperature and surface net radiation is referred to as GLEAM+ERA5-Land.
Analogous comparisons between GLEAM+ERA5 and GLEAM+ERAInterim (using forcing
fields from ERA-Interim) can be found in Martens et al. (2020). Surface latent
heat flux, surface sensible heat flux, and the Bowen ratio from GLEAM+ERA5 and
GLEAM+ERA5-Land were evaluated against the eddy-covariance data described in
Sect. 3.7.1 at daily timescales.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.8       Skin temperature</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The skin temperature is the theoretical temperature of the
Earth’s surface that is required to satisfy the surface energy balance. It
represents the temperature of the uppermost surface layer, which has no heat
capacity and thus can respond instantaneously to changes in surface fluxes. The
top surface layer of the ECMWF’s land surface model, CHTESSEL, covers the top
7cm. In order to evaluate the skill of ERA5-Land land surface temperature
(LST), NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MYD11C3/MOD11C3
version 6 product was used in this study. It provides monthly LST and
emissivity values for Aqua and Terra in a 0.05&#9702; (5600m at the Equator)
latitude– longitude climate modelling grid (CMG), for day and night overpasses.
Chen et al. (2017) recommended the use of the MODIS LST average ensemble (i.e.
from Aqua-day, Aqua-night, Terra-day, and Terra-night) for climate studies and
reported validation with 156 flux tower measurements (RMSE=2.65, mean
bias&lt;±1K). In this study, the MODIS observational LST ensemble was
constructed following Chen et al. (2017) and used as a reference for comparison
with ERA-Interim, ERA5, and ERA5-Land monthly averaged LST data for the period
January 2003 to December 2018 (16 years). MODIS data were firstly averaged to
monthly timescales and then upscaled at two spatial resolutions: to 0.1&#9702;
for comparison to ERA5-Land, and to 0.25&#9702; for comparison to ERA5 and
ERA-Interim data. Bias, Pearson’s correlation (R), and RMSE were computed on
the full time series, and correlation was also computed on the anomalies (RAN),
calculated as departures from the monthly climatology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4          Evaluation results</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.1       Soil moisture</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 6 shows the evaluation results for ERA5-Land and ERA5
top soil moisture layer against 5cm depth measurements for sites in Europe,
Africa, and Australia. For sites in Europe, both ERA5-Land and ERA5 show
similar STDD and bias distributions (Fig. 6a, c). The distribution of R is also
similar but the median value obtained for ERA5-Land is slightly higher than for
ERA5 (Fig. 6b). In contrast, ERA5 shows a slightly higher median for the
anomaly correlation, although ERA5-Land shows a more compact distribution (Fig.
6d). In Africa, only 10 sensors at a depth of 5cm were available. The STDD
shows a larger distribution for ERA5Land (Fig. 6e); however, the latter shows
slightly lower bias and better R (Fig. 6f, g). The anomaly correlation is
largely improved (Fig. 6h). Finally, in Australia, ERA5-Land box plots (Fig.
6i–l) clearly show lower STDD and bias, and higher R than ERA5 (both for the
original time series and the anomaly times series). The evaluation obtained
over Europe, Africa, and Australia shows an overall slightly better performance
of ERA5-Land over ERA5; in particular, the anomaly correlation of the top layer
is improved predominantly in the warmest climates. Nonetheless, these results
for the top soil layer are not conclusive, partly because of the insufficient
number of available stations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To get more insight into the soil moisture evaluation,
ERA5-Land and ERA5 were also evaluated over North America, where most of the in
situ sensors are available, including several hundreds of sensors at 20 and
50cm depths. In addition, the same evaluation was performed for ERAInterim to
address the evolution of ERA5 and ERA5-Land with respect to the previous
reanalysis generation. Figure 7 shows the evaluation results for ERA5-Land,
ERA5, and ERA-Interim soil moisture top three layers against measurements for
sites in North America at 5cm (Fig. 7a–d), 20cm (Fig. 7e–h), and 50cm depth
(Fig. 7i–l). ERA5 and ERA5Land surface soil moisture obtains quite similar
results for all the metrics, although the median of the correlation and anomaly
correlation are slightly better in ERA5-Land. ERAInterim obtains lower values
for these last two metrics, meaning that the land improvements in CHTESSEL
compared to the old TESSEL scheme lead to better representation of the soil
moisture dynamics. In deeper layers, the performance of ERA5-Land is better
than that of ERA5, in particular for the third layer, for which ERA5-Land shows
lower STDD (Fig. 7i) and higher correlation (Fig. 7j, l) than ERA5. It is worth
mentioning that for the third soil layer of the model, ERA5 performs quite
similarly to ERA-Interim, which is likely due to the initialization of the ERA5
streams with ERA-Interim soil moisture conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, the results were also analysed site per site taking
into account the confidence interval of the Pearson correlation obtained for
ERA5 and ERA5-Land versus the in situ measurements. A correlation difference is
considered significant if the confidence intervals do not overlap. The Pearson
correlation difference for ERA5 and ERA5-Land at 5cm is significant for 382
sensors, of which 64% shows higher correlation for ERA5-Land. The correlation
difference at 20cm is significant for 417 sites, of which 72% show a higher
correlation for ERA5-Land. Finally, the correlation difference at 50cm is
significant for 479 sites, of which 88% show a higher correlation for
ERA5-Land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>variability of the errors given that many sites are located
in complex terrains or coastal area.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Considering the mountain sites, ERA5-Land shows lower RMSE
over the sites with moderate altitude, i.e. between 1300 and 2500m (cdp, rme,
wfj). ERA5-Land also clearly presents the lowest errors in the Arctic site
(sod) and in the boreal forest sites (oas, obs, and ojp). Overall, the biases
are smaller in ERA5-Land than in ERA5 (and ERA-Interim) at these sites. For the
mountain sites, all reanalyses are characterized by a negative bias, which is
very likely due to the smoothing of the orography at the resolution of the
reanalysis. The higher horizontal resolution of ERA5-Land, compared to ERA5,
helps to reduce the bias at cdp, rme, and wfj caused by a better orographic
representation. However, the agreement with in situ observations at the sites
located in very high mountains (snb and swa, located at altitudes greater than
3300m) is slightly better with ERA5 than with ERA5Land. It should be noted that
the four nearest grid points indicate a much larger spread of errors for ERA5
than for ERA5Land. Therefore, compensating errors could lead to better
performance of ERA5 at the nearest grid point. The maritime site (sap) also
shows lower RMSE in ERA5. At this site, the data assimilation can help in
adding/removing snow mass for the right reason (snow density is overall well
represented at this site; see time series in Fig. S1 in the Supplement), even
though the spatial variability is higher in ERA5. On the contrary, at the
forest sites (oas, obs, ojp), snow depth assimilation can remove snow mass to
compensate for errors in snow density, the latter which are not considered in
the assimilation system. Finally, noteworthy are the improvements in the
transition between ERA-Interim and ERA5, in particular at Sodankylä (sod),
which is caused by improved parameterizations of the snow model introduced
between ERA-Interim and ERA5 productions (Dutra et al., 2010).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 9 shows the maps of the RMSE difference between
ERA5-Land and ERA5 snow depth estimates when compared to in situ observations
of the GHCN network, for both North America and Europe. Over the US, and
particularly over the Rockies region, ERA5-Land generally outperforms ERA5 in
terms of lower RMSE (see Fig. 9a). In these highly complex terrain regions, the
higher horizontal resolution of ERA5-Land adds value by providing more
realistic orographic contours. However, over Europe (i.e. mainly Scandinavia;
see Fig. 9b), where ERA5 uses a dense SYNOP network of observations in the snow
assimilation system, ERA5 performs better than ERA5-Land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>shows the RMSE as a function of the height of each station.
The stations were binned in height ranges of 250m (0– 250, 250–500, etc.) and
the distribution of the RMSE is displayed for each height range using box
plots. For heights below &#8776;1500ma.s.l., ERA5 performs slightly better than
ERA5-Land, while for heights between &#8776;1500ma.s.l. and &#8776;3000ma.s.l.
ERA5-Land outperforms ERA5, as a result of the better resolution. For stations
above 3300ma.s.l., ERA5 performs better, which can be due to compensating
errors, similarly to the ESM-SnowMIP sites. In addition, it should be noted
that the number of sites at these very high altitudes is small, and therefore
the statistical results should be interpreted with caution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.3       Lakes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ERA5 and ERA5-Land hourly estimates of LSWT compared to
the hourly data of the Alqueva reservoir showed that ERA5-Land obtained
statistically significant MAE reduction by 2.2% (see Table 4). While this is a
positive result, ERA5Land data showed some rapid changes in the lake mixedlayer
depth (up to 5m), which led to a quick rise of the lake surface water
temperature (up to 20 &#9702;C). The left plot of Fig. 11 shows the bias
distribution for hourly data; even though the frequency of bias around zero is
larger for ERA5Land (indicating more accurate estimates of LSWT), errors due to
unrealistic temperature rise are also visible at higher frequency between 3–4
&#9702;C.</p>

(25%) and upper quartiles (75%), and the horizontal lines within each box
represent the median value of the distribution. The black line represents the
number of stations grouped at each bin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The comparison of the ERA5 and ERA5-Land daily averaged LSWT
with Alqueva reservoir and the 27 Finnish lakes data also showed statistically
significant reduction of ERA5-Land MAE (among 28 lakes) by 1.2% (from 2.71 to
2.68 &#9702;C; see Table 4). It should be noted that the lake parametrization
scheme relies heavily on the lake depth input data. With the increase of
resolution in ERA5-Land, lake depth values change as well. For only those lakes
whose depth became more realistic in ERA5-Land as result of the higher
resolution, the MAE was statistically significantly reduced by 23.8%; however,
for only those lakes whose depth remained unchanged despite the change of
resolution, the MAE was still statistically significantly reduced by 9.6%,
showing the positive influence of higher-resolution atmospheric input. The
right plot of Fig. 11 shows, for daily data, a reduced amount of large positive
errors (cold bias) in ERA5Land and a larger frequency of errors around zero
bias. Finally, only 272 lakes with averaged in situ measurements for the summer
months, with 10- to 15-year data records, could be used for comparison with
ERA5 and ERA5-Land LSWT estimates. The comparison showed statistically
significant MAE increase by 1.0% for ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 (see Table 4).
If one bears in mind that FLake was not designed for saline, fed by glaciers or
mountains and warm lakes (that excludes 26 exceptional lakes) the MAE of the
remaining 246 lakes is similar in ERA5 and ERA5-Land. The right plot of Fig. 12
shows the geographical distribution of the 26 exceptional lakes and their
averaged ERA5Land MAE, which shows large LSWT errors, even beyond 10 &#9702;C.
Note that errors for these lakes are very similar for ERA5. If, as a result of
the higher resolution, only lakes whose depth became more realistic in
ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 are taken into account, the MAE is statistically
significantly reduced by 1.4% in ERA5-Land. FLake was specially designed for
medium depth (under 50m) lakes. Sev-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.4       River discharge</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Results of river discharge performance for GloFAS forced
with ERA5 and ERA5-Land are shown in Fig. 13. The overall global median KGE0
across 1285 observation stations improves from 0.26 (with an interquartile
range of &#8722;0.04 to 0.49) for GloFAS-ERA5 to 0.37 (0.08, 0.57) for
GloFASERA5-Land (Fig. 13a). In the decomposition of the KGE0, the global median
Pearson correlation also improves from 0.60 (0.43, 0.75) to 0.64 (0.49, 0.77)
(Fig. 13b), and global median bias ratio improves from 0.73 (0.50, 1.13) to
0.89 (0.66, 1.15) (Fig. 13c), which is equivalent to a 16% reduction in overall
bias. There is very little difference in variability errors between GloFAS-ERA5
and GloFAS-ERA5-Land (Fig. 13d).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 14 shows the spatial distribution of river discharge
skill, measured by the KGESS. GloFAS-ERA5-Land shows positive skill compared to
the GloFAS-ERA5 benchmark in 65% of stations with a global median KGESS of 0.08
(&#8722;0.06, 0.25). Largest improvements in skill are found in North America,
Europe, northern Russia, southern Africa, and Australian catchments. There is a
substantial decrease in skill (i.e. KGESS&lt;&#8722;0.2) when forcing GloFAS
with ERA5-Land runoff instead of ERA5 in 11% of stations, mainly located in the
western US and South America. Care must be taken in spatial representativeness
of these results, as the observation network is sparse in some regions of the
world, particularly in large parts of Africa and Asia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.5       Energy fluxes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.5.1    Evaluation against eddy-covariance sites</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The left panel of Fig. 15 shows the violin plots of the
ERAInterim and ERA5-Land turbulent fluxes (compared to in situ eddy-covariance
measurements).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ERA5-Land compares systematically better to in situ
measurements than ERA-Interim, with higher RAN values for the heat fluxes and
the Bowen ratio and for both subdaily and daily temporal resolutions, as well
as presenting lower bias and MAE. This result is expected, as the land surface
model used in ERA5-Land benefits from many improvements compared to that of
ERA-Interim (see Sect. 2.4). The right panel of Fig. 15 shows the same plot but
comparing ERA5 and ERA5-Land. The violin plots are much more similar, biases
for both fluxes are only marginally better in ERA5-Land (the median of the
distribution is nearly the same, but the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>75% percentile is always lower), and MAE is typically lower
for &#955;&#961;E in ERA5-Land (except at 1-hourly resolution) but higher for
H. On average, correlations for ERA5-Land are only better for &#955;&#961;E at
daily resolution and for the Bowen ratio. It also should be noted that all
statistics are on average better for H than for &#955;&#961;E, both in ERA5 and
in ERA5-Land (with lower bias, lower MAE, and higher RAN); this matches the
results reported by Balsamo et al. (2015) and Martens et al. (2020). To
investigate potential areas of significant improvement/degradation, the left
panel of Fig. 16 shows the maps of RAN differences of &#955;&#961;E between
ERA5-Land and ERA5, over the continental United States (CONUS). RAN is
typically better for ERA5-Land across most US stations, especially near the
coasts and around the lakes, where high resolution is more important. In Europe
(Fig. 16, middle panel), results are very mixed, but for most of the stations
in the Alps ERA5-Land performs worse than ERA5. Although for Australia ERA5-Land
is slightly better than ERA5 (see right panel of Fig. 16), it is not the case
for all stations. The results for the Bowen ratio are aligned with those of
&#955;&#961;E (see Fig. S3), whereas those of H are more favourable for ERA5
(see Fig. S2).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To study the influence of the eddy-covariance sites’
altitude and air temperature in the heat fluxes, Fig. 17 shows the standardized
mean RAN (circles) and MAE (squares) of H and &#955;&#961;E as a function of
the station altitudes and air temperature. The results are in line with those
presented in the violin plots. ERA5-Land clearly performs better for
&#955;&#961;E and the Bowen ratio, and the largest differences between ERA5 and
ERA5-Land are obtained for the sites located at high altitudes, where more
extreme values are obtained and forcing errors are increased. Although for H
the differences are smaller, ERA5 performs overall better than ERA5-Land and
the strongest differences are also seen at high-altitude sites.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.5.2    Evaluation using GLEAM</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The turbulent fluxes estimated from GLEAM forced with
temperature and surface net radiation from ERA5 and ERA5Land were also
computed. ERA5-Land surface fluxes perform better than GLEAM+ERA5-Land when
confronted to in situ measurements (see the violin plots in Fig. S4), except in
terms of bias, in agreement with Martens et al. (2020). This result reflects
the quality of the CHTESSEL land surface model, which has greatly improved the
parametrization of turbulent energy fluxes and evidences the added value compared
to a simpler model as in GLEAM, designed to consider only input variables that
can be observed from satellite. Figure 18 is similar to Fig. 17 but comparing
ERA5Land and GLEAM+ERA5-Land, as a function of elevation and air temperature,
at daily resolution. As expected, almost for all stations temperature and
elevation, ERA5-Land heat fluxes match better the in situ reference
measurements. The exceptions are towers at the highest altitudes where forcing
errors are generally larger. Comparing GLEAM+ERA5 and GLEAM+ERA5-Land, the
differences are very small, sug-</p>

LST for the time period 2003–2018, as well as global maps of their correlation
and RMSE with respect to the MODIS LST average ensemble, constructed as
indicated in Sect. 3.8. While differences in mean LST are apparently minimal
among the two simulated products, there is a better correlation of ERA5-Land
with MODIS in the tropical band. The low correlation obtained between the
simulated and the remotely sensed LST over tropical forests should be taken
with caution since persistent cloud cover as well as cloud contamination
effects are known to have an impact on remotely sensed observations, leading to
important differences in their absolute values (Jiménez-Muñoz et al., 2016;
Gomis-Cebolla et al., 2018). Notably, ERA5-Land systematically compares better
than ERA-Interim to MODIS LST in terms of RMSE, particularly at high latitudes.
As shown in the averaged statistical scores on Table 5, there is an overall
improvement of ERA5 and ERA5-Land LST simulations with respect to ERA-Interim,
yet only modest improvements are achieved in ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 LST,
mainly on bias and RMSE. The better correlation of MODIS with ERA5 and
ERA5-Land than with ERA-Interim is more evident in RAN maps (see Table 5 and
Fig. S5).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To further scrutinize the impact of the ERA5-Land higher
horizontal resolution on LST simulation, ERA5 LST was resampled to 0.1&#9702;
and then global maps of the RMSE difference (1RMSE) between ERA5 and ERA5-Land
with respect to the MODIS LST average ensemble were calculated. The improvement
of ERA5-Land on LST in coastal areas is clearly visible in the 1RMSE maps, as
shown in Fig. 20 for the European domain. The time series at the coastal pixel
in Norway illustrates how ERA5-Land LST simulations compare better to the
observational record by capturing more closely the annual cycle in its whole
range of variability, and therefore decreasing bias and RMSE, while the
correlation with the MODIS product is very good and almost similar for both
reanalyses. The time series at the other two specific locations illustrate
regions of complex topography exhibiting slightly lower RMSE of ERA5-Land
(Iceland), and of ERA5 (Alps), with respect to the MODIS LST average ensemble.
These results highlight improved LST simulations of ERA5Land on coastal
regions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6          Discussion and conclusions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This paper presents the new global ERA5-Land reanalysis.
When the historical part is completed, it will provide a detailed record of the
land surface evolution from 1950 to the present through a series of key land
surface variables representing the water and energy cycles. The temporal
resolution is hourly and the horizontal resolution is 9km, making it unique and
suitable for a growing number of land surface applications. The quality of
ERA5-Land fields was evaluated by direct comparison to a large number of in
situ observations collected mainly for the period 2001–2018, as well as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>by comparison to additional model or satellite-based global
reference datasets. The evolution of the operational ERA series of reanalyses
was also assessed by adding ERA-Interim and ERA5 global reanalyses to the
evaluation exercise. Key components of the water and energy cycles were
analysed. Overall, the water cycle is improved in ERA5-Land compared to ERA5
according to the different variables evaluated, whereas the energy cycle
variables show similar performance; both ERA5 and ERA5-Land perform substantially
better than ERA-Interim. The main evaluation findings are as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a.         Soil moisture: the box plots show a consistent
improvement of the statistical metric distributions of ERA5Land with respect to
those of ERA5, in particular the improvement is more marked for the root-zone
soil moisture. The root zone is characterized by a slow temporal variation and
thus a good initialization is crucial to reach equilibrium on relatively short
timescales. ERA5 root-zone soil moisture is penalized by initialization from
ERA-Interim, which leads to a multi-annual artificial trend of the time series
over arid to semi-arid climates, where the standard deviation of soil moisture
is low. On the contrary, the shallow surface layer responds quickly to
short-term meteorological forcing variables, and hence, for the top layer,
ERA5-Land only improves slightly on ERA5 estimates at the reference stations.
The main added value of high resolution at the top layer is to account for the
correct soil type that changes the saturation level and the minimum level at
which evapotranspiration no longer occurs. Consequently, ERAInterim, with
coarser resolution, shows the lowest performance of the three reanalyses
datasets. Supporting these findings, ERA5-Land participated in a soil moisture
intercomparison of 18 products against large number (826) of in situ stations
and performed strongly (Beck et al., 2021).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>b.         Snow: ERA5-Land snow mass and snow depth
estimates are improved on mid-altitude mountains, where the higher resolution
provides better orographic contours and the temperature correction is also
important. However, ERA5 snow depth estimates match measurements slightly
better at the highest mountains (&gt;3300m). At these altitudes, uncertainties
in both the forcing and in the model parametrization are larger and</p>

observational record. Time series of ERA5, ERA5-Land, and MODIS time series at

The differences in RMSE (1RMSE) and R (1R) between ERA5 and ERA5-Land with
respect to MODIS LST at each</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>location are reported.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>can contribute to the growth of errors; processes like snow
transport and sublimation, which are not considered in the current snow scheme
formulation, can be important at these altitudes, as well as errors in the
amount of solid precipitation. It is also worth noting that for high-altitude
stations, the spread of errors is larger in ERA5 compared to ERA5-Land, which
could lead to error compensation. The results per continent show the best
performance of ERA5-Land snow fields in the US, especially in complex
orographic areas, where spatial resolution is foremost. It implies a more
accurate near-surface air temperature, especially over mountains, which leads
to a better representation of the sensible heat flux and therefore better
estimates of the snow depth. Also, there is a limited number of snow depth in
situ observations assimilated in ERA5 over the US (de Rosnay et al., 2015), and
therefore the assimilation system hardly compensates for systematic
model/snowfall biases. Contrarily, ERA5 performs better over Scandinavian
countries. In general, snowfall in the IFS suffers from a systematic positive
bias (snow overestimation) in Europe. Although data assimilation is intended to
correct for random errors, snow depth reports assimilated in ERA5 alleviate the
systematic snow excess where these reports are assimilated. The improvement of
the snow scheme over the previous decade is also reflected in the overall
better scores of ERA5 compared to ERA-Interim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>c.         Lakes: LSWT is slightly improved in ERA5-Land at
hourly and daily averaged steps with respect to in situ data at sites in
Portugal and Finland. Note however that at punctual times of the warm period in
Alqueva, sudden jumps of the ERA5-Land mixed-layer depth lead to unrealistic
LSWT. For instance, on 3 August 2018, from 08:00 to 09:00LT, the mixed-layer
depth jumped 5.3m, leading to a 17.6 &#9702;C increase and increasing the
Alqueva reservoir LSWT to 40.7 &#9702;C. Jumps are caused by a simplistic parametrization
of the summer stratification in the lake scheme, as temperature is computed
differently in calm and turbulent conditions. Ways to limit these jumps and to
enable a smoother and more realistic transition are currently being
investigated at ECMWF. The lake parametrization scheme relies heavily on
accurate lake depth input data, and therefore poor data impact its ability to
accurately simulate lake parameters such as LSWT. The higher resolution of
ERA5-Land allows, in many cases, a more accurate specification of lake depth.
Thus, isolating lakes whose depth is more realistic using the ERA5-Land grid
(i.e. only lakes whose depth in the ERA5-Land grid matches better in situ
observations), the LSWT MAE is reduced by more than 20%. The positive influence
of a higher-resolution atmospheric forcing was also verified by isolating lakes
whose depth remained unchanged either using ERA5 or ERA5-Land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both reanalysis LSWT estimates were also compared using as
reference a global inventory (1995–2009) based on summer observations from
satellite sensors. In this case, the performance of both reanalyses is quite
similar (excluding exceptional lakes where FLake performs poorly). The
uncertainty of lake depths in the global inventory is larger and it could have
an impact on these results. However, even when comparing only lakes with a
depth less than 50m (FLake was designed for medium-depth lakes), the performance
of ERA5-Land LSWT does not show significant improvement compared to ERA5 (based
on MAE). This might be due to the averaging technique used for the in situ
measurements, which uses satellite measurements representing one instant in
time rather than continuous hourly data. Nevertheless, in summer months, ERA5
LSWT biases are on average 2.2 &#9702;C cooler than observations, whereas
ERA5-Land LSWT is just 1.3 &#9702;C cooler.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>d.         River discharge: river discharge integrates the
various components of the water cycle. With improved soil moisture, snow, and
lake characterization in ERA5Land, all these being physical inputs of river
discharge generation, it is not surprising that the GloFAS river discharge
obtained overall better scores when used with input data from ERA5-Land
(GloFAS-ERA5-Land). This improvement in the skill is likely due to a number
factors, such as higher horizontal resolution (from which smaller catchments
benefit), improved representation of root-zone soil moisture and temperature
(which contributes to increase the correlation and reduce biases with river
discharge observations), and snow processes (which should be an advantage in
northern latitude catchments). Also, the fact that ERA5-Land does not directly
assimilate any observation, as is the case for ERA5, has shown to have positive
impacts on the closure of the water balance (Zsoter et al., 2019). They have
shown that the snow data assimilation is detrimental to the hydrology in large
parts of the snow-impacted Northern Hemisphere in the ERA5 experiment, compared
with the offline simulation without coupling and land data assimilation (such
as ERA5-Land). The average snow increments in ERA5 are negative, due mainly to
the too-slow snowmelt in CHTESSEL, which consequently removes water from the
hydrological system. This contributes to decreasing the dominantly negative
biases in a large area with subsequently deteriorating</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the hydrological performance. The exceptions are in the
western US and Amazonian basins. For the former, a later and larger snowmelt
due to an excess of accumulated snow over high peaks could lead to a decrease
in correlation and increased biases with respect to in situ observations. The
degradation in the Amazonian basin is small, linked to an underestimation of
the surface and subsurface runoff (not shown), which in turn is likely caused
by a slight overestimation of evaporation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>e.         Energy fluxes: ERA5-Land shows modest
improvements in &#955;&#961;E and the Bowen ratio compared to ERA5 estimates,
although the H is slightly better in ERA5, with the largest disagreements
mainly found at high altitudes, where values are more extreme and errors are
accumulated. The high resolution of ERA5-Land seems to be the reason for
providing better fluxes at stations near the coasts or lakes. Under water
stress conditions (e.g. the central US, California, and Australia) the
&#955;&#961;E in ERA5-Land appears to be more accurate than the ERA5
counterpart. In Europe, the results are mixed. Nonetheless, the fluxes in the
Alpine region are better in ERA5. This result coincides with a lower
performance of ERA5-Land (compared to ERA5) in terms of snow and river
discharge estimates in this area when compared to in situ measurements. A
possible cause may be the overestimation of snow depth in high-altitude peaks
in ERA5-Land (which does not benefit from the partial removal of snow by data
assimilation), which in turn may lead to a late snowmelt and vegetation
exposure to the atmosphere which would influence transpiration. Both ERA5 and
ERA5-Land outperform GLEAM estimations of turbulent fluxes. The advantage of
GLEAM over reanalysis lies in its simplicity and its ability to run on remote
sensing forcing. However, through the use of common reanalysis forcing, the
higher realism of the more complex model in ERA5-Land (CHTESSEL) is evident.
The latter includes multiple processes that appear relevant for the surface
energy partitioning and are not explicitly represented in simpler models
designed for the remote sensing of evaporation, such as GLEAM. Altogether, this
paper did not provide clear evidence of an overall superior performance of
ERA5-Land surface energy fluxes over ERA5. While these results are
inconclusive, one should bear in mind that they are only evaluated over 65
eddy-covariance sites. To better understand the possible added value of
ERA5-Land turbulent fluxes, a more detailed evaluation based on towers located
in contrasted climatic conditions and including other global reference datasets
is recommended.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>f.          Skin temperature: the skin temperature (in this
paper referred to as LST), as a variable reacting quickly to any change in
surface fluxes, shows modest improvements in ERA5-Land compared to ERA5.
However, as it has been the case for all variables evaluated in this paper,
ERA5 and ERA5-Land LST are improved when compared to ERA-Interim. ERA5-Land
obtains the lowest global averaged RMSE with respect to MODIS data, which is
partly due to the contribution of the coastal points that better simulate the
amplitude of the annual cycle of LST, and is a consequence of the higher
spatial resolution of ERA5-Land. Other small disagreements between ERA5 and
ERA5-Land are found over complex terrains, but they do not seem to favour any
particular reanalysis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With the above results, one can conclude that the horizontal
resolution matters and is a very important aspect in the accurate simulation of
the spatial and temporal evolution of the hydrological cycle. However, this
paper could only provide evidence of a modest improvement of the surface fluxes
of ERA5-Land compared to ERA5. The latter conclusion is based on an evaluation
with respect to a small number of available samples. Other important aspects of
the added value of ERA5-Land are the production speed (that allows cutting-edge
land surface modelling advances to be incorporated more rapidly) and the
consistency presented over multi-decadal timescales (that could set the basis
to enable reliable trend analyses), all of them making ERA5-Land a state-of-the-art
dataset for multiple land applications. The reduced impact of discontinuities
by using longer spin-up periods could also be a crucial factor to obtain
accurate trends over multi-decadal periods for variables slowly changing in
time, for instance, the root-zone soil moisture (see bottom panel of Fig. 3).
Finally, it is important to emphasize that an exhaustive evaluation of all land
variables simulated in ERA5-Land is not feasible in a single paper. While this
paper provides significant validation elements to demonstrate the added value
of ERA5-Land, the wider scientific community is invited to carry out more
detailed evaluations of individual components. For example, a more extensive
validation of soil moisture following internationally agreed best practice
(Gruber et al., 2020) is highlighted as an area for further research. While, in
wider terms, we recommend the use of ERA5-Land fields over ERA5 for all types
of land applications, one should factor in their choice elements such as
available computer and data handling resources, importance of spatial
resolution versus data volume, area of application, temporal consistency, etc.
With the public release of ERA5Land, research and development have already
shown some caveats of the dataset, such as the treatment of soil temperature in
permafrost regions (Cao et al., 2020). Further studies comparing with
alternative well-referenced sites, as well as with regional and global datasets
is encouraged. For instance, Pelosi et al. (2020) compared UERRA regional reanalysis
(Copernicus Climate Change Service, 2020) forced by ERA-Interim and ERA5-Land
to assess the performance of evapotranspiration estimates based on weather data
in the south of Italy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7          Perspectives</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ERA5-Land dataset presented in this paper is the first
operational land reanalysis of the ERA series. This paper has demonstrated its
added value by comparing ERA5-Land estimates to a wide range of in situ
observations, ERA-Interim, and ERA5 reanalyses. Despite the overall observed
improvement of the land states in ERA5-Land, there is scope for improvement for
several components, which will be the focus for the construction of future
enhanced versions. They are discussed below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the context of C3S, all operational products require an
estimate of the associated uncertainty. Currently, estimates of uncertainty of
ERA5-Land variables are those corresponding to the ERA5 counterpart. ERA5
uncertainties are obtained by running a 10-member EDA, which also provides the
background-error estimates for the deterministic HRES 4D-Var data assimilation
system (Hersbach et al., 2020). The first tests conducted at ECMWF running an
ensemble of offline simulations with an ensemble of initial conditions and
atmospheric forcing provided by the 10-member EDA of ERA5 indicate that the
spread of the land surface variables is unrealistically low (not shown). The
likely reason is that in the production of the ERA5 ensemble the physics of the
surface model is not perturbed; i.e. the surface model is assumed to be
perfect. To obtain realistic uncertainties, not only input and forcing
parameters to the land surface model should be perturbed but also key variables
and parameters of the surface scheme (e.g. MacLeod et al., 2016; Orth et al.,
2016), adding the contribution of land surface model error to the ensemble
spread. Future studies are envisaged to investigate this path to provide
meaningful uncertainties to land reanalysis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the most important driving variables of ERA5Land is
precipitation. Systematic model-based precipitation biases can potentially
spread into the land state estimates. ERA5 precipitation (used as input forcing
of ERA5-Land) benefits from a much improved data assimilation system
assimilating millions of extra observations compared to its predecessor
ERA-Interim. Indirectly, ERA5-Land benefits from these extra observations as
well. However, ERA5 still has large precipitation biases, especially in tropical
regions. A recent bias-adjusted dataset based on ERA5 has been produced for
impact studies with a 0.5&#9702; resolution (WFDE5, Cucchi et al., 2020). That
study demonstrated the added value of the bias corrections on large-scale
hydrological modelling. Future versions of ERA5-Land could consider similar
approaches, taking into account such bias-corrected coarserresolution forcing
datasets as well as their availability in near-real time. In addition to
coarse-scale near-real-time bias correction, high-resolution downscaling could
be also explored. Such a correction could be based on a climatological
rescaling of precipitation based on a high-resolution reference climatology
(e.g. Karger et al., 2017).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The land surface model used in ERA5-Land, CHTESSEL, also has
the option to estimate carbon fluxes and its coupling with plants transpiration
through the A-gs formulation (Jacobs et al., 1996; Calvet et al., 1998;
Boussetta et al., 2013a). This module is operationally active for the
vegetation, and it allows estimates for the carbon fluxes in a modular approach
with evaporation being computed through a resistance approach (Jarvis et al.,
1976). This choice is adopted since its integration in the operational numerical
weather prediction still requires further developments (Boussetta et al.,
2013a). Although carbon fluxes are an actual output of ERA5-Land, they are not
made available because of persistent biases. Agustí-Panareda et al. (2016)
implemented a biogenic flux adjustment scheme (BFAS), which uses the Copernicus
Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) inversion by Chevallier et al. (2010) to
correct for the biases in the 10d budget of the modelled carbon fluxes at
continental scales. This is currently being extended for usage in the FLUXCOM
product (Jung et al., 2020) in order to bias correct the two components of the
biogenic fluxes (gross primary production and ecosystem respiration)
separately. Figure 21 shows carbon fluxes from the ERA5-Land simulation with
and without the BFAS bias correction compared to observations from the ICOS-ETC
network (ICOS-ETC Drought 2018 Team, 2019). The impact of the bias correction
is largest during boreal summer when the vegetation is most active and the soil
respiration is also largest. A future version of land reanalysis may include
the bias-corrected carbon fluxes which will also benefit from the ongoing and
future land surface model developments associated with the representation of
the vegetation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another important research path with large potential is the
revision and use of dynamic auxiliary data. Currently, ERA5Land assumes a fixed
land cover, whereas leaf area index (LAI) and albedo are based on a static
monthly climatology. The former assumes that land cover remains unaltered for
the complete reanalysis period and that cities are non existent, whereas the
latter will not be able to accurately represent more frequent LAI anomalies.
Based on the research conducted in the ESA-CCI programme, C3S provides (through
the CDS) climate data records of land cover at yearly frequency, as well as a
close-to-real-time global map of LAI with 10 to 20d latency. Moreover, recent
studies have identified errors in the diurnal cycle of land surface temperature
over the Iberian Peninsula associated with the current land cover used in
CHTESSEL and 1h model time steps (Johannsen et al., 2019; Nogueira et al.,
2020). Therefore, the revision of the land cover and LAI to a new database as
well as the introduction of their interannual variability is expected to
provide more realistic land conditions as input to the surface scheme. There
are also ongoing efforts to revise the vertical discretization of the
vegetation roots and soil layers distribution (e.g. Mueller-Quintino et al.,
2016; Stevens et al., 2020), which could complement the land cover and
vegetation updates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, the coupling of the offline simulations to an
offline data assimilation system is a promising approach. The advantages are
multiple, in particular the assimilation of lo-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>cal datasets (precipitation radar observations, local soil
moisture networks, etc.), permitting small adjustments of land state estimates.
Undoubtedly, this will go accompanied by an increase in computational cost.
Ongoing efforts to improve the parallelization of the land model will allow
global highresolution simulations for several decades to be performed at
affordable computational costs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All the components discussed above are currently under
research, but they are not the only ones. ECMWF is currently working with a
flexible, modular system called ECLand (Boussetta et al., 2021) which allows us
to separately develop several modelling aspects of the land surface, such as
the increase in the number of soil layers or the introduction of a multi-layer
snow scheme, as well as make progress on other longer-term perspectives such as
the introduction of a groundwater storage or the reduction of the model time
step. All the above ongoing developments will provide the basis for a future
new version with improved accuracy for the land states at multi-decadal
timescales.</p>
